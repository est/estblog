  <blockquote>
  <p>Frankly, I'm worried about libraries -- not because I think e-books will replace their dead tree counterparts specifically, but rather because the library as an institution is an anathema to today's notions of intellectual property. It's a loophole left over from a more permissive and libertarian era.<br>
  As an example of how much people's perspectives have changed, a few years back on Slashdot there was an article about DRM where the story submitter indicated that he had found a good use for DRM: electronic libraries. DRM in e-books could be used, he suggested, to enforce check-out periods and late fines. There was broad agreement from the masses, who were overwhelmingly tech-savvy and anti-DRM.<br>
  And then someone pointed out, insightfully, that the whole reason libraries had check-out periods and late fines in the first place was because of inventory limitations, i.e., scarcity. With only limited copies of a book and many more people wanting to read it, forcing people to return it in a timely manner was a requirement, not an ideal. Fines were not created to fund the library, which is a government subsidized institution -- they were created as a punitive measure, to encourage people to return books they had checked out so that others could read them.<br>
  In an e-library, such measures are stupid -- you have a system where scarcity no longer matters, where me checking out a book can't possibly keep anyone else from reading it.<br>
  See, this is the thing: libraries are socialist and subversive, and always have been. The media companies have always vehemently opposed them conceptually. Why should any member of the public be able to walk into a public library, obtain (for free) a library card, and borrow -- share -- something that they didn't pay to create?<br>
  They didn't like them in the 19th century and they don't like them now. But the dead tree library is an institution that dates back to antiquity -- so killing it was never a politically viable thing to do.<br>
  Because really, the natural modern analog of the library is government subsidized Bittorrent. People sharing information and knowledge without thought of profit -- for the common good.</p>
