  <p>The following are not all correct, but interesting enough to read as a fresh perspective of view.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Rape of Nanking was a horrible event, but you'll find few Japanese that deny it nor didn't study it. The massacre is required reading and studying starting at all the thousands of middle schools in Japan except for 10 private schools which are run by ultra-right wing Japanese neo-conservatives. They are essentially the KKK of Japan and represent less than 1% of the population. </li>
<li>Iris Chang's "The Rape of Nanking", although best known, is also filled with factual errors as she is not a trained historian. Pro-China experts on the topic says she did <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/8j199/chinese_make_film_about_nanjing_massacre_its_very/c09gfzr">more harm than good</a>. She gets holidays, events, and other easily verifiable dates wrong again and again. Many of her sources are questionable and proven false. However it is the most popular contemporary book on the massacre in the last two decades. Chang also had a difficult time differentiating the tiny right wing fringe Japanese with the rest of normal every-day Japan. As a result her characterization of the Japanese is accepted as fact by many Chinese and became added fuel for hate against the Japanese to a point where it is commonplace in China today. </li>
<li><strong>Japan's top leaders have apologized dozens of times</strong> (at least a dozen from the various Prime Ministers and the Japanese Emperor himself) for the Nanjing massacre and comfort women, and offered huge reparations which <em>China accepts every year</em> (the money but not the apologies). </li>
<li>Japanese descendants of Imperial Japanese soldiers involved in the Nanjing massacre have independently, but quietly, offered over a million in USD to <em>each</em> of the Nanjing victims with <em>no strings attached</em>. </li>
<li>Japan has more experts on the Nanjing massacre than even the Chinese. Most of them have a much higher estimation of those victimized in the massacre than the Chinese experts. (This one was a shock to me as I'm ancestrally Chinese and was told otherwise) </li>
<li>The Nanjing Massacre is a mixed sorepoint for the Chinese Communist government because it gives sympathy for the Chinese Nationalists (who were in power over China at the time). </li>
<li>Chiang Kai Shek ordered a firebombing of Nanking that actually killed far more people than the Japanese but no one cares because he's Chinese and sadly it seems "Chinese on Chinese murder doesn't count". This was a terribly failed bid to thwart the Japanese and killed only a few Japanese soldiers but scores of Chinese. Chiang always blamed the Japanese for the firebombing but evidence from two decades ago squarely proves it was Chiang. </li>
<li>The Russians did worse by raping far more women and children and mass murdering when sacking Berlin during WW2 but few middle-school textbooks report this around the world (presumably because it would lend sympathy for some Nazi Germans). </li>
</ul>

<p>The true disastrous country which do real harm to China is Russia and Japan.</p>
