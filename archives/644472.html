  <p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1008246">HN上</a>讨论了一个如何写500字空洞无物文章的案例。假如老师要求写一个关于 WHY COLLEGE FOOTBALL SHOULD BE ABOLISHED 的文章</p>
<p>这里是你能想到的版本：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>College football should be abolished because it's bad for the school and also for the players. The players are so busy practicing that they don't have any time for their studies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>这里是职业化灌水的最终版：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, it seems to me that college football should be abolished. The reason why I think this to be true is because I feel that football is bad for the colleges in nearly every respect. As Robert Hutchins says in his article in our anthology in which he discusses college football, it would be better if the colleges had race horses and had races with one another, because then the horses would not have to attend classes. I firmly agree with Mr. Hutchins on this point, and I am sure that many other students would agree too.<br>
One reason why it seems to me that college football is bad is that it has become too commercial. In the olden times when people played football just for the fun of it, maybe college football was all right, but they do not play college football just for the fun of it now as they used to in the old days. Nowadays college football is what you might call a big business. Maybe this is not true at all schools, and I don't think it is especially true here at State, but certainly this is the case at most colleges and universities in America nowadays, as Mr. Hutchins points out in his very interesting article. Actually the coaches and alumni go around to the high schools and offer the high school stars large salaries to come to their colleges and play football for them. There was one case where a high school star was offered a convertible if he would play football for a certain college.</p>
<p>Another reason for abolishing college football is that it is bad for the players. They do not have time to get a college education, because they are so busy playing football. A football player has to practice every afternoon from three to six and then he is so tired that he can't concentrate on his studies. He just feels like dropping off to sleep after dinner, and then the next day he goes to his classes without having studied and maybe he fails the test.</p>
<p>Also I think college football is bad for the colleges and the universities because not very many students get to participate in it. Out of a college of ten thousand students only seventy-five or a hundred play football, if that many. Football is what you might call a spectator sport. That means that most people go to watch it but do not play it themselves.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why I agree with Mr. Hutchins that college football should be abolished in American colleges and universities.</p>

<p>想当年。。。俺们中文作文灌水方法都是扩写能扩写词组，然后每一段结束都是一个字加一个句号占一整行。。。。。。虽然最后得分都不怎么高，但是能pass～～～～最后自己读自己的文章都发现，黑压压一大段话只讲了一件很简单很弱智的事情。。。相当的恐怖。。。</p>
<p>所以，发展NLP来做 tl;dr 工具是相当有前景的啊～～～～</p>
