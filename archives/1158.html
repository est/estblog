  <blockquote>
  <p>The use of atomic weapons was widely blamed on a primate named Albert Einstein. Even Einstein himself had agreed with this opinion. He was a pacifist and had suffered abominable pangs of conscience over what had been done with his scientific discoveries.</p>

  <p>"I should have been a plumber," Einstein said just before he died.</p>

  <p>Actually the discovery of atomic energy was the result of the work of every scientist, craftsman, engineer, technician, philosopher, and gadgeteer who had ever lived on Terra. The use of atomic energy as a <em>weapon</em> was the result of all the political decisions ever made, from the time the vertebrates first started competing for territory.</p>

  <p>Most Terran primates did not understand the <strong>multiplex nature of causality</strong>. They tended to think everything had a <em>single</em> cause. This simple philosophic error was so widespread on that planet that the primates were all in the habit of giving themselves, and other primates, more credit than was deserved when things went well. This made them all inordinately conceited.</p>

  <p>They also gave themselves, and one another, more blame than was deserved when things went badly. This gave them all jumbo-sized guilt complexes.</p>

  <p>It is usually that way on primitive planets, before quantum causality is understood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's easy to blame a single reason, because it's easier and we are too lazy to think of those trivial reasons.</p>
