<p>TED的演讲总是那么激动人心。Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor的这个亲生体验的故事非常引人入胜。</p>

<p>Dr. Jill提到的一些细节让我非常觉得déjà vu。看到自己的皮肤和外界的区别逐渐模糊，突然觉得文字非常陌生，那种内心的超级平静，与宇宙和能量一体的感觉，是非常美妙的。可惜我只是在过去偶然遇到过几次，并没有作者体会那么强烈。相信古人修行高僧可以自由出入这种境界吧。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For those of you who understand computers, our <em>right</em> hemisphere functions like a <em>parallel</em> processor, while our <em>left</em> hemisphere functions like a <em>serial</em> processor. The two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers.</p>

  <p>Our right hemisphere is all about this <em>present moment</em>. It's all about "right here, right now."<br>
  Our right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies. Information, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment smells like and tastes like, what it feels like and what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere.</p>

  <p>My left hemisphere -- our left hemisphere -- is a very different place. Our left hemisphere thinks <em>linearly</em> and <em>methodically</em>. Our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details, details and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes all that information, associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere thinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you gotta remember to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning." It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important, it's that little voice that says to me, "I am. I am." And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me "I am," I become separate. I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you.</p>

  <p>Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere, where we are. I am the life-force power of the universe. I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is. Or, I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become a single individual, a solid. Separate from the flow, separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we" inside of me. Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when?</p>
