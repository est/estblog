  <p>I found out the corresponding gene code by accident, for Yuran Race mod it's located under</p>
<p><code>~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/SteamApps/workshop/content/*/2844129100/Bio1.4/Defs/YuranBioTitle.xml</code></p>
<p>So the official description can be found at (or <a href="https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/Xenotypes">wiki</a>):</p>
<p><code>~/Library/Application\ Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/RimWorld/RimWorldMac.app/Data/Biotech/Defs/GeneDefs/</code></p>
<p>I need to use the dev tool to modify gene of my pawn, so here's the table:</p>
<pre><code>import os
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
p = os.path.expanduser('~/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/RimWorld/RimWorldMac.app/Data/Biotech/Defs/GeneDefs/')
fields = 'defName label description biostatCpx biostatMet biostatArc'.split()
print('| %s |' % ' | '.join(fields))
print('|--------' * len(fields) + '|')
for f in os.listdir(p):
    root = ET.fromstring(open(p + f).read())
    for elem in root.findall('GeneDef'):
        vals = [t.text if isinstance(t:=elem.find(x), ET.Element) else '' for x in fields]
        if vals[0]:
            print('| %s |' % ' | '.join(vals))
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<style type="text/css" id="pre-table">
    style#pre-table + table{
        font-size: 65%;
    }
