  <p>摘录一些</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jack Voth, Algenol’s information technology chief, stumbled on something odd: a telnet connection to its videoconference camera from an Internet Protocol address in China</p>
<p>Hacking attacks come from many countries, he says, but most are efforts to steal credit-card information. Chinese hackers, by contrast, tend to target trade secrets and unique technology.</p>
<p>Algenol executives did not know that Aliyun was the cloud computing part of Alibaba, and they never tried to make contact.</p>
<p>Alibaba said that two former Algenol employees had signed up for an Alibaba marketing e-mail. Once they left Algenol and the marketing e-mails bounced back, Alibaba said that its own security system checked on the accounts and that Algenol mistook those inquiries as attacks.</p>
<p>Voth, however, is not convinced. He disputed Alibaba’s explanation about the marketing e-mails to employees who left Algenol four years ago, and said that to mistake an Alibaba security response for an attack would mean that there was a flaw with the widely used firewall language called Snort, which is updated constantly.</p>
<p>He said that since Jan. 1, each of 539 IP addresses has attacked Algenol computers 5,000 times or more.</p>
<p>The largest numbers of hacking probes came from the United States, China, Taiwan and Russia, he added. The single IP address that has attacked Algenol the most is a German address; the top Chinese IP address attacking Algenol ranked 10th.</p>
<p>Voth said the fight to protect Algenol’s computer system would be a long one. “A rule of thumb is that you have security by obscurity,” Voth said. “We’d rather have a low profile. But clearly the bad guys have our addresses.”</p>

<p>尼玛这报道真心无敌了。几个想法：</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>地球上媒体都一个德行，真jb恶心。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>商标和责任的对外宣传，国内还有非常，特别，很长的路要走。Aliyun对外云服务老外压根就不明白，也懒得联系。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>外行做安全的特点就是：特别傻逼而且特别自信。</p>
