              <h2 class="card-title">橘生淮南为橘，橘生苏联为？</h2>
            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><blockquote>
<p>在二十世纪上半叶，苏联柑橘专家(Citrology在当时是一个重要学科)在-30℃的低温下在<strong>户外</strong>种植（亚）热带植物，而且不使用玻璃或任何燃料辅助。<br />
During the first half of the twentieth century, Soviet citrologists grew (sub)tropical plants in temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius – outdoors, and without the use of glass or any fossil fuel-powered assistance.<br />
"渐进式抗冻" “Progressive cold-hardening”<br />
进口的柑橘品种只在黑海沿岸几个孤立的地方存活，那里的小气候特别有利。为了使柑橘类水果更好地适应寒冷，苏联的柑橘学家采用了一种叫做 "渐进式抗冻"的方法。这使他们能够创造出适应当地生态条件的新品种，这种栽培策略最初是为杏树和葡萄开发的。<br />
Imported citrus varieties only survived in a few isolated points along the Black Sea coast, which enjoyed a particularly favourable microclimate. To better prepare citrus fruits for cold, Soviet citrologists followed a method called “progressive cold-hardening”. It allowed them to create new varieties which were adapted to local ecological conditions, a cultivation strategy which had originally been developed for apricot trees and grapes.<br />
该方法包括将珍贵的树木种子种植在其原始位置的更北边，然后等待它结出种子。然后将这些种子再向北种植，并反复重复这一过程，缓慢但稳定地将柑橘品种推向不太适宜的气候。利用这种方法，Rostov-on-Don(北纬47°N的一座城市，挨着亚速海)的杏树最终可以在北方650公里以外的Michurinsk(北纬52°N)种植，他们在那里开发了适应当地气候的杏树种子。另一方面，直接将Rostov 杏树的种子种植在Michurinsk证明是不成功的。<br />
The method consists of planting a seed of a highly valued tree a bit further north of its original location, and then waiting for it to give seeds. Those seeds are then planted a bit further north, and with the process repeated further, slowly but steadily pushing the citrus variety towards less hospitable climates. Using this method, apricot trees from Rostov could eventually be grown in Mitchurinsk, 650 km further up north, where they developed apricot seeds that were adapted to the local climate. On the other hand, directly planting the seed of the Rostov apricot tree in Mitchurinsk proved unsuccessful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>不要再吹儒家智慧了。无产阶级才是真的智慧。。。</p>
<p>~~这故事唯一的毛病就是 Rostov 和 Michurinsk 这城市的位置似乎弄反了？反正纬度没太对劲。。。~~</p>
<p>更新：原来是 Rostov-on-Don，不是 Rostov(北纬57°N的一座城市，莫斯科以北202km涅罗湖岸边)</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33647875">via</a></p>
<p>另外「橘生淮南为橘，生淮北为枳」这句话本身也是错的</p>
<blockquote>
<p>橘和枳原本就是两个根本不同的物种，在生物学特征中，橘与枳同属芸香科，虽枝、叶、果实形态相似，但枳比橘耐寒，可逾淮河而生。而橘喜温，逾淮河过了1月0℃等温线就会被冬天的霜雪冻死。所以，不是橘到淮北变成了枳，而是淮北只有枳而无橘。</p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>今天在看到<a href="https://www.solidot.org/story?sid=73284">有人发</a>了个《男性觉醒知识库》觉得太荒唐了。然后就看到<a href="https://v2ex.com/t/893244">评论区</a>有人贴了个《教姐妹们如何要彩礼》更无语。。出处未知，作者未知。请选择性食用。本文使用 DeepL 翻译，有小修订。</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: This is a DeepL translated feminist piece with minor modifications, the origin &amp; authenticity is unknown, I stand neutral to this article</em></p>
<h2>Bride price Guide for Fellow Sisters 教姐妹们如何要彩礼</h2>
<p>The proletarian mentor Friedrich Engels said in <em>Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pairing family, also known as monogamous marriage, originates from private ownership. It is characterized by the male subjugation of the female in gender relations, the disappearance of the female from public life and her forced return to the family, as well as by the denial of sexual freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feminist theory holds that "marriage is essentially a form of male exploitation of women, an oppression of the powerful by the vulnerable." Combined with our extensive practice in real life, it is easy to see that many women are deprived of their birth rights, education rights, employment rights, etc. for various reasons. But those with vested interests are never satisfied and are further infringing on the rights of their sisters. Since there is too much content, I will not expand here, but only briefly discuss how sisters can protect their rights in marriage.</p>
<p>When sisters get married, they always encounter confusion: How do you want the bride price? How can I make my husband's family pay attention to it and not be a sufferer in the past? How to buy gold jewelry? How to get added to the ownership of the house, etc. all kinds of problems plagued the sisters to be married, today the author through this article one-stop solution to the sisters on the wedding trouble.</p>
<p>Glossory:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bride price</code> 彩礼</li>
<li><code>mama's boy</code> 妈宝男</li>
<li><code>ugly duckling</code> 凤凰男</li>
</ul>
<h3>I. Choosing a partner</h3>
<p>Marriage is a big deal, is the second birth of our women, so how to choose a reliable marriage object is the key to the key.</p>
<p>On the marriage, especially marriage to remote places, I have heard a very apt phrase: "If the male makes you mad at noon, and your father's can't slap him in the face overnight, then you have married too far." Sisters can tend to this principle when choosing a marriage partner.</p>
<p>The following details about how to choose a marriage partner.</p>
<h4>(A) the classification of men</h4>
<p>Contemporary Chinese men are generally of worst quality. Lazy, shy, greasy, obscene, no taste of life, no aesthetics, no formality, and even w many are <strong>Mama's Boy</strong>. Therefore, sisters must be extra cautious when looking for a marriage partner, you may want to date several at the same time, the best of the best, after all, in nature only the strongest males are qualified to mate and reproduce. The most important thing is to find a quality genetic provider for your children, even for the sake of the next generation. In this case, I will divide men into three categories: Quality Male, Ugly Duckling and Ordinary Men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quality Male: refers to the height of 180cm-185cm, business parents or working in the government plus physically healthy and with a good pension; at least two loan-free property registered in Tier-I cities (Beijing, Shanghai, GuangZhou, Shenzhen), liquidity of no less than 3 million RMB, annual income not less than 50,000 RMB, a master's degree or above men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ugly Duckling: a man who meets any four of the requirements for a "Quality Male".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ordinary Men: a man who meets any two of the requirements of a "Quality Male".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creatures: Not recommended. Don't bother to contact anyone below the standard of the Ordinary Men</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>(B) Mate Selection Strategy</h4>
<p>THe Quality Male are one-in-a-million chance. Grab it while you can and never let go. If you are losing it, get pregnant and make him a daddy. The sooner you gets this the better, the winner takes all.</p>
<p>For Ugly Ducklings, dating two or more at the same time, choice the best. Prioritize a handsome tall one, after all, the good looking bores your less in future days.</p>
<p>For Ordinary Men, you can consider use a "spare tire", "male BFF" strategy, just in case you meet a Ugly Duckling or a Quality Male is a jerk, then at least a guaranteed option, this type of man is best limited at 3-5, too many too busy. Give them an above-friendship but not-yet-lovers state, do not let them easily get you.</p>
<p>Pay special attention: Be wary of Mama's Boy! Be wary of Mama's Boy! Be wary of Mama's Boy!. Because Mama's Boy's money = his mom's money ≠ your money, if you meet Mama's Boy, even if he is Quality Male, don't engage. In order to identify Mama's Boy, trust your sixth sense, when you assume a man is a Mama's Boy, then he must be.</p>
<h3>II. Marriage Preparation</h3>
<h4>(A) Tame men</h4>
<p>Warning: the following strategies do not apply to Quality Male, Quality Male are OK as long as they are not Mama's Boy, not alcoholic, no gambling, no domestic violence, no prostitution, everything else is acceptable.</p>
<p>Please sisters remember the phrase: "Never marry a man who do not kneel down to wash the feet". In the dating stage, no matter what our own character is, we have to make a cool and poker face. This will give the man to form a psychological expectation that he needs to pay desperately more to cater to your approval. But you can not be too cool, give back little sweetness to warm his confidence, make him feel that you are unreachable, to maintain a status of near-approchable.</p>
<p>Tactic one: for example, he invited you to dinner, buy him a milk tea in return; he invited you to an amusement park or bar, you can send him a keychain, plush toys and other small gifts.</p>
<p>Second tactic: deliberately throw some tantrum but not too excessive, make him argue, and then you pretend to be angry, blacklist his contact, wait for him to apologize &amp; ask forgiveness</p>
<p>Third tactic: occasionally care about his parents, let him think you tender and considerate, and then take him to see your parents (he can not go empty-handed), giving him a feeling that you have taken him as family.</p>
<p>In conclusion: men are a very naive creature, they are easily touched by your small guestures, to imaging you are the true love. So you have to learn to play small to game big, giving a little to increase the man to your niceness. Taming men should be like taming dogs, to be rigid and soft, only then they can be controlled to the direction you want. But remember not to over doing it, that will swing men away, unless you really wanted to, or want to force him to do something silly. Don't believe the honesty, too much pressure will only make the crack. Of course, you can not be too soft, then you will lose.</p>
<h4>(B) Manipulate the man</h4>
<p>After you have tamed the man, basically the man has been obedient to you. This is the time you have to decisively seize his salary card, bank card, the reason is afraid that he would waste money, you have to plan for the future life. This time the man will feel that you are right, and will think that you are really thinking about your future.</p>
<p>After the economy grab, you'd gave him some weekly allowances. Give more if you are happy, less if not. But do not spent all the money as this belongs to the premarital property, you are at most considered the keeper. Refrain to spend after marriage.</p>
<p>You can take the money to invest at funds or something, he will be too shy to ask for the profits, instead he will praise your housekeeping skills.</p>
<p>Tighten the economic control gradually, and crack down his private savings. For example, if for three months in a row you give him 1000 yuan pocket money he does not complain, he even gifts you sometimes, then it is recommended to drop to 800 yuan in the begining of the fourth month. Maintain a level just enough for his spendings. After all, the more he spends, the less you get.</p>
<p>If he questions this behavior, you will show him the financial gains to shut him up, if necessary, you can send friends or friends in common to pressure him, of course, do not forget to let your BFF to play: "My boyfriend only need 500 yuan a month pocket money, you got 800 that's really quite a lot."</p>
<p>After mastering the man's economic lifeline, you have to occasionally spend your money, note that it is your money not his, buy his parents some gifts. This generation of men's parents are very easy to handle, they are still very simple-minded, or the kind of "male dominant business female dominant family" or "a good daughter-in-law to prosper three generations" of mental. Give them an image of you as a "good daughter-in-law" and let them put pressure the man so you can get married soon.</p>
<h3>III. Marriage Negotiations</h3>
<p>Once you start preparing for marriage, then you will inevitably avoid talking about the bride price, dowry and other issues. Because of your previous operation to please his parents, at this time, just ask for the bride price. The groom's parents will be generous, they are in a hurry for the wedding.</p>
<p>First of all, the gold, in some places "five golds" are needed to get married, some places for "three golds", but no matter what, the advice is don't over do it. Because this thing is not worn every day, and will lose value if sold, it is too much of a loss, a better alternativeis focusing on bride price and property.</p>
<p>The amount of bride price varies, in principle, not less than 200,000 RMB. Real-estate co-ownership is naturally required, we will skip the details, but here we talk about the dialog tactics whenever applicable:</p>
<h4>1. The Attitude Card</h4>
<p>The fact is the amount of bride price doesn't matter, it's an attitude issue, it shows the importance out of the groom's mind. In case of bargining from the groom, bring out your BFF, pretend that she asked for X amount of bride price, gave birth to two sons to the groom's family, and is now living happily. Just make it up because they won't look it up.</p>
<p>Note: If your groom is taking it serisoly, say that if you want the attitude, you'd rather donate the money to charity in your name, so that you can prove the itention,  it would be meaningful. If he still doesn't want to give the bride price, staying away from such a stingy brain bad man is recommended</p>
<h4>2. The Tradition Card</h4>
<p>You insist on claiming that the bride price is just a custom in your hometown, your whole family is very traditional, so if you don't want it, your parents will lose face. And where you from the price is not negotiable. This method can be used in combination with the "attitude card" for better yields. Finally, it boils down to the question: "Do you really love me?" The "Are you trying to fake a marriage on me?" is a soul-crushing question.</p>
<p>Note: If you are "open" in your private life, have richer dating experiences, with more sex experience, not that conservative, then don't use this method. For example, you often state something like "Does it matter to be a virgin? How is it a woman's duty to give birth to a child and take care of the household? The Qing Dynasty is long gone!" and such. Then give him the "tradition matters, it's always this way", then possibly the groom will clear his head take the high ground.</p>
<h4>3. Compensation card</h4>
<p>You insist that giving birth is for the man, the bride price is the compensation for the woman's suffering in childbirth, after all, pregnancy will seriously affect your career, you had the opportunity to become a multi-millionaire or even billionaire. Because of the child, a mother will have to settle for a monthly salary of 3,000 RMB. At the same time, your body is greatly affected by the birth of a child, there are postpartum conditions, so you must ask for compensation.</p>
<p>Note: To examine the IQ of a man, use this method selectively. Some men will be thankful for your dedication after hearing you say that having a child is not easy. Some other will have huge empathy for his mom and convert to Mama's Boy and be grateful and obedient to his mom. The worst case he will think: since you say the baby is for me, then we do not even need a marriage, you give me the baby, I give you the money and we are clear? Or he will discuss the price of surrogacy with you and think that we should replace the mother and keep the child. Sisters, believe me, such a man must not be married. If you marry, your day of divorce is counted.</p>
<p>Remember, if you divorce a man, you must claim custody of the child, because it is your child, and with the child you can ask him for alimony and succession rights!</p>
<h4>4. Value card</h4>
<p>This type of method is applicable to sisters who are outstanding in appearance and assets. "I'm so good, I'm not worth this much bride price?" "Do I really care that you have this little money?" You should express your disdain for this bride price with an attitude of deep apathy, as well as the posture of "marry me of fuck off". But do not forget, after the marriage your money is yours, his money are also yours, soft hearted to men means hard hearted to oneself. Li Xueqin also said: "Women should pity themselves, pity men brings bad luck for life." So never let easy on the male.</p>
<p>Note: If the other side is more blunt , such method is likely to fail.</p>
<h4>5. The Binding card</h4>
<p>This method is suitable for sisters who have been dating men for a long time. "I have been with you for so long, my youth is not worth this money?" "Do you love me or do you love money?" "You really love me or this money is all you can provide?" Bind the bride price to your time, youth, &amp; heart, force the groom to obey. Men are very reflective creatures, they will always introspect their own problem, like am I a miser?, so when you use this method along with cold violence, such as crying while staring at him, do not speak, call his parents to tell them you might never be able to call them parents-in-law again, or directly tell him the wedding is canceled. Don't be afraid to use your feelings to blackmail him, because he can't find anyone better than you and your previous good moments together. The people around him would usually persuade over and over, and most likely his parents will start scolding him.</p>
<p>Note: Pay attention to cultivate his ability to introspect at soon as possible, do not let him to punder "my own youth is not worthy?" "Do I gave less than you?". This method is suitable for men who have been tamed for a long time.</p>
<h4>6. The "Assurance" method</h4>
<p>When the groom thinks the bride price is too high, you have to reason with him: "I don't need the bride price either, but I want some assurance", "I can't take care of my parents if I marry you, so I have to leave some money for my parents." "I'm very insecure, I'm afraid of being hurt in marriage, I just want a guarantee." "My family raised me for so many years, paid for my education, so what's wrong with asking for a dowry?" No matter what happens later, get the bride price first. After that, you can then talk about gender equality, even the one child must have to bear the responsibility of parental care. Men always admit this in general.</p>
<p>Note: If you have a well-off family background, this method would be a bit funny, it is recommended sisters married far away or sub-par family conditions use it wisely.</p>
<h4>7. The Double Act</h4>
<p>Double act method basically means good cop bad cop. Don't ask for anything, just prepare for marriage, Let your parents be the bad cop, ask the terms, use the first 6 methods, negotiate with the groom. When pressure amounts you just be the good cop to pull back a little. This is the best strategy, avoid direct conflict between you and the groom's family, on the other hand, can also make the man take your favor, you can speak up.</p>
<p>The most important thing to note: some men will think twice, they think that marriage is a matter of two families, you are just pretending to be innocent. So it's a good idea to always keep the image of a baby girl, with no calculating behind, the "baby doll" type of sister.</p>
<p>Please combine the tactics above when negotiating about the bride price for better  effects. Some people may feel that the above methods are schemes, then I have to tell you, as the famous criminal psychology expert Professor Li Meijin once said: "The biggest payoff for women is pregnancy, and their womb is another kind of property. And then there is breastfeeding, the most precious food product from a mother. So in return, men must provide household, financial support to raise the family, this is the natural way, break this contract, there will be consequences......".</p>
<h3>III. The wedding</h3>
<p>There is nothing special about the wedding, just arrange it in your way, the man pays the bill. Remember that during the wedding day you must not test the man too much, or he will be too embarrassed. Although he paid the bride price, but his heart will be somewhat uncomfortable. Men are all about face, so they trade money for face, you just use swap his face for money.</p>
<p>Let him arrange the red envelope in advance, all in proper place, reception of bride's family should be slightly challenged, do not screw up the rest of wedding.</p>
<h3>IV. The married life and divorce</h3>
<p>As already said in the previous article, marriage is the second birth of women, we may not be born into a good family at the beginning, but can live a good life through a good marriage. A friend of the author once said to me that marriage itself is a transaction. We women can compromise certain false things in marriage, such as the last name, family, paternal rights and so on for exchanging true values. This matter weights less if you think about it less, so I suggest that the sisters do not care the surname, it's you gaving birth to your children, how can it not be yours? But these stuff can be used as a bargaining chip, do not let the husband get too easily.</p>
<p>According to China's judicial practice, generally speaking, divorce a year after marriage, the bride price is awarded 100% to the woman as joint property after the marriage or as a gift arising from the marriage. The dowry is characterized as the woman's pre-marital property. Therefore, even if you are not satisfied with your husband, you'd better stay on for more than one year.</p>
<p>According to our judicial practice, even if a woman cheats in marriage and has a child that is not her husband's own, the child is still to be raised by the man as a legitimate child.</p>
<p>Again according to our judicial practice, even if the man bought the house before marriage, under his full payment, but once added your co-ownership, then you are able to divide a certain percentage.</p>
<p>Still according to China's judicial practice, in certain areas, "cheating while married, the agreed property goes to the party with no fault" prenuptial agreement is recognized by the court.</p>
<p>So I suggest that sisters on a date must study the marriage law, consult a lawyer, sign a good prenuptial agreement. Whether the other party will cheat, best to believe that men are unable to withstand temptation. Without going into too much detail, there are many tactics, in order to the harmony of the family I can only stop here.</p>
<p>When divorce must pay attention to emphasize that the husband practice domestic violence, alcoholic, gambling and other vices. In daily life to pay attention to keep the evidence, make small problems big, and then force him to apologize, let him sign a desist letter. Don't underestimate these warranties, they are recognized by the court in case of a divorce.</p>
<p>In the case of domestic violence, it is important to remember that even if you havn't been abused, you should always take pictures of your casual injuries for other reasons as evidence of domestic violence. It is the other party's business to clarify and the lawyer's business to argue, so you are responsible for providing all kinds of evidence there can be.</p>
<p>The most important point is that you should try to find a female judge for your divorce case! Because only women judges will help women, only girls will help girls!</p>
<h3>V. Conclusion</h3>
<p>To believe in the state, believe in the law. The state can't wait for every man to get married, because men without a family is on the loose and destablize the society. Sisters must have confidence, don't be afraid of trouble, whether it is microblogging, socialnetworks, the court or the husband's work place, as long as you dare to fight, in most cases the other party will compromise.</p>
<p>Sisters, you must believe in your own power, protect yourself, and be an independent woman and excel. Cheers</p></p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>玩 WebRTC 的时候发现它居然内置<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/11/webrtc-sending-dtmf-in-firefox/">支持了 DTMF 拨号音</a>。</p>
<p>这里就简单科普一下，DTMF 就是手机电话拨号音，数字按键按下去嘟嘟嘟响那个。具体就2个频率调谐：</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>DTMF</th>
<th>1209Hz</th>
<th>1336Hz</th>
<th>1477Hz</th>
<th>1633Hz</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>697Hz</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>770Hz</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>852Hz</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>941Hz</td>
<td>*</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>#</td>
<td>D</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>于是兴趣来了想做一个 demo 玩玩，写了半天调试不通，报错</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VM987:1 Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'insertDTMF' on 'RTCDTMFSender': The 'canInsertDTMF' attribute is false: this sender cannot send DTMF.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>仔细研究了下<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Using_DTMF">这玩意</a>，原来 WebRTC 不直接传音频，而是发一个控制信号，由接收方播放出音频，所以你需要本地创建一个真实的双工 RTC 并打开麦克风权限，才能播放DTMF音频。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebRTC doesn't send DTMF codes as audio data. Instead, they're sent out-of-band, as RTP payloads. Note, however, that although it's possible to send DTMF using WebRTC, there is currently no way to detect or receive incoming DTMF. WebRTC currently ignores these payloads;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>这样就走远了。于是又手痒用 <code>AudioContext()</code> 糊了一个。一共不到1000字节。</p>
<p><a href="https://lab.est.im/dtmf">https://lab.est.im/dtmf</a> <a href="https://github.com/est/snippets/blob/master/dtmf/index.html">源码</a></p>
<p>嗯。就挺简单的。特别是那个 oscillator有个 <code>.stop(0.2)</code> 参数可以避免 <code>setTimeout</code> 的麻烦。网上很多教程整复杂了。</p>
<p>btw 把一些老脚本挂在 lab 域名下。<br />
btw2 把 RSS 改成全文输出了。</p></p>

<p>我也看得个半懂，但是文章写得太tm 好了。强烈推荐阅读。因为最近 Nature 有人搞了个大新闻，说他们跑了个机器学习模型分析最近50年的粒子对撞机数据，发现质子里「有的时候」包含一个比质子重的 charm quark。</p>
<p>还学到一个奇妙的比喻，教科书的说法是，质子由 2x <code>up quark</code> 和 1x <code>down quark</code> 构成。这是个巨大的骗术。真实的情况是，质子就是个垃圾堆，里面有成千上万亿的稀奇破玩意。大概可以分成3类，一大堆 antiquark，一大堆 quark 和 一大堆 胶水。只是恰好  <code>up quark</code> 比 <code>up antiquark</code> 多 <code>2</code> 个，<code>down quark</code> 比 <code>down antiquark</code>  多 <code>1</code> 个，外加一大堆胶水(<code>gluon</code>) 和  <code>quark-antiquark pair</code> ，挤在一个 非常小的区域内，以接近光速的速度飞来飞去。</p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>半夜看到个东西，翻来覆去睡不着，就记录一下。</p>
<p>很多人知道老毛的「第三世界」理论，这也是为数不多的由中国人完全贡献通行欧美的顶流政治概念。但是很少有人知道20世纪顶级哲学家 波普 Karl Popper 有另外一套「三个世界」理论。这三个世界分别是：</p>
<ol>
<li>真实的物质世界</li>
<li>人的个性 (character)</li>
<li>人的思想 (idea) </li>
</ol>
<p>卧槽，深邃。作为假装不惑好多年的人，仍然能在生命的这个阶段学习到新的姿势，感觉非常过瘾，让人回味初一自己琢磨哲学的愉快时光。</p>
<p>人的思想又称理性，是通过推理和因果构成的神性世界；人的个性是由情绪、脾气和兽性驱动的喜怒哀乐感性世界。很多人会把这两者混淆成一回事，但是从根本上来说是错误的。人的个性我理解大多是先天遗传(nature)决定的，人的理性是人作为 homo sapien 的独门绝技，是把镜像神经元发挥到极致的后天(nurture)集大成机制。</p>
<p>说起这个我又想起来，以前觉得儒家的王阳明「知行合一」很厉害，直到我看到「自觉、觉他、觉行」这个说法：</p>
<ol>
<li>首先要了解自己，独善其身</li>
<li>其次要以己度人(pun intended)，考虑对方感受和社会整体，毕竟人类是群居动物，由社会定义的存在</li>
<li>最后要把思考成果应用到行动上，否则都是瞎jb空谈，其实这玩意也讲究方法论</li>
</ol>
<p>儒家作为一个上古玩交际起家的教派，没把「他觉」单独拎出来强调，从这个层面上来说落了下风啊。</p>
<p>其实我想说的是，波普恐怕还漏了第四个世界，这个世界是基于 idea 上的虚拟机，这个虚拟机可以去模拟和推演他人的行为、个性和思维的世界，这也是中国人最擅长的，算计他人。</p></p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>帮朋友看一家公司，专门做爬虫的。找到一些有意思的信息，各位可以先猜猜这个题：</p>
<p>2020年以来，大陆各类刑事犯罪中起诉人数排名前3的罪名是？</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) 网上乱发言</li>
<li>(B) 偷东西</li>
<li>(C) 诈骗</li>
<li>(D) 开车出事</li>
<li>(E) 打架、杀人、伤人</li>
<li>(F) 帮别人修理电脑或者网络</li>
<li>(G) 贿赂</li>
</ul>
<details>
  <summary>正确答案：</summary>
  (D) (B) (G) 帮助信息网络犯罪活动罪（以下简称帮信罪）是2015年11月起施行的刑法修正案（九）新增罪名，主要指行为人明知他人利用信息网络实施犯罪，为其犯罪提供互联网接入、服务器托管、网络存储、通信传输等技术支持，或者提供广告推广、支付结算等帮助的犯罪行为，是电信网络犯罪的重要“帮凶”。2019年11月，最高检联合最高法制定出台《关于办理非法利用信息网络、帮助信息网络犯罪活动等刑事案件适用法律若干问题的解释》，明确了帮信罪定罪量刑标准和有关司法认定问题。近年来，特别是2020年10月“断卡”行动以来，检察机关起诉涉嫌帮信犯罪案件上涨较快，目前已成为各类刑事犯罪中起诉人数排名第3的罪名（前两位分别是危险驾驶罪、盗窃罪）。

<p>然后说回爬虫，最近看到<a href="https://www.spp.gov.cn/spp/llyj/202202/t20220215_544538.shtml">《明确越界网络爬虫行为的刑事处罚边界》</a>，虽然不是法规文件，但是可以参考。总体来说：</p>
<ol>
<li>如果你是 IT  从业人员，那么明知故犯罪加一等</li>
<li>小爬没事，把别人服务器爬出500错误了就麻烦了。需要登录或者有反爬最好不要去碰</li>
<li>公开数据理论上没事。不遵守 <code>robots.txt</code> 也无所谓</li>

<p>遇到一个问题，Cloudflare 官方有提供浏览器客户端IP变量 <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/headers/#cloudflare-headers"><code>CF-Connecting-IP</code></a> 但是缺少端口，查了下可以自己通过 <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/request-header-modification/reference/fields-functions"><code>cf.edge.client_port</code></a> 这个变量获得， <a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/t/need-cf-connecting-port-for-french-law/319505/8">方法</a>是在进入 CF网站管理 面板 → Rules → Transform Rules → HTTP Request Header Modification 里添加一条请求头规则。如图：</p>

              <h2 class="card-title">论电子阳痿</h2>
            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>看到个贴 <a href="https://www.v2ex.com/t/884992">https://www.v2ex.com/t/884992</a> ，也算有一些感触吧，在博客记录一下现在的想法。</p>
<p>以前英国贵族喝茶是要加糖的，因为普通人压根接触不到制成品糖块，加糖是有成本的装逼表现；后来北美甘蔗种植园和远洋贸易导致平民和工人也开始喝茶加糖了，于是贵珠又流行喝清茶了。。。。</p>
<p>以前川菜也是不辣的，只是麻。后来辣椒从南美流传到云贵川，地主带头吃辣，而且吃出了军备竞赛看谁更辣说明更装逼。。。后来辣椒烂大街普及了，川菜又开始反向装逼了，比如开水白菜的发明的初衷就是为了证明川菜不辣也有上等菜品。。。</p>
<p>电子阳痿怎么说呢，从某些程度来说，选择电子娱乐在当年是一种世外桃源的感觉。以前的娱乐无非是 ktv ，武侠小说，吃喝嫖赌这些。能玩电子游戏，首先家里得有个 386/486/586，那个年代能花几万搞一个电脑还是得很有魄力的。最不济也得是个书香门第。敢玩游戏的，比如你内存不足了得会改中断和加扩展内存啊。</p>
<p>游戏往往跟别的娱乐简直不是一个级别的比较。比如当年比较简单的游戏形式为 Multi-User Dungeons (MUD) ，想起最近我在看互动教娃之类的感触，我了解到美国有一个做了十多年的  inquiry-based learning  叫 <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/company/about">AoPS</a> ，我被这种教学方式震撼了。因为我自己有娃才知道这样做有多难，这种方式是首先老师得在某个学科、领域有「完备」的知识储备，然后娃从一个 problem 开始提问，你跟他讲解需要理解的解决方法，需要储备的基础知识，解决这一个问题之后，需要把得到的经验总结然后形式化，然后提出更多的问题，进而学习到所有数学知识。要通过软件做到这一点，就需要对知识树进行建模然后做一个有向无环的遍历。然后找着找着发现一些写小说的工具就有这样的功能，你先整理一个时间观和人物关系大纲，然后每个章节就是这些联系的具体实现和阐述。突然我意识到，这 TM 不就是几十年前互动文本 RPG 游戏的核心原理么。你需要创建很多 NPC 对话的上下文并且穷举所有的选项组合，这不就等效于整理某个学科知识来做一个教学系统么。再比如，游戏里创建3D场景，如今被ILM从《The Mandalorian》开始引入好莱坞，无绿幕拍摄已经快称为行业基操。所以当时玩的不是游戏，而是玩的是计算机图形学和美学的最前沿成就。</p>
<p>记得我小时候，玩电子游戏还约等于玩小霸王。这玩意在当年被美名其曰「学习机」，但实际上买回来都被拿来玩FC红白机了。这事其实在国外也发生过，无数高手都是通过折腾 Commodore 64 无师自通了 6502 汇编。这又让我想起了文曲星，很多人走向码农就是因为初高中被一个能写 BASIC 代码的电子辞典给迷上了。能在这些设备玩上游戏，那只是无数对技术钻研的汗水、执着和努力的一项亮眼的成果而已。</p>
<p>而如今呢，天下游戏，不归吃鸡便归MOBA。纵然这两种类型也有其乐趣之处，但是其玩法为了迎合市场和几十亿人口，把门槛已经降到了最低并且能恰到好处的维持一定量的兴奋值，这一切都归功于数值策划的在反胃和上瘾之间作出的微妙平衡。</p>
<p>所以归根结底为啥电子阳痿呢，游戏已经被太多的人玩滥了。它没有与众不同的属性，它不 cool，它除了赢得一局带来的短暂成就感，并不能带来「与众不同」的持续归属感。商业的力量让电子游戏称为一个能挣钱的行业，但商业也让电子游戏从上古时期的 玩游戏-拆游戏-再发明游戏 的双向过程，变成了充值消费就能变强的单向过程，让人在赢得了对手或者 AI 之后变得无比的寂寞，这一种空虚的贤者时间让人觉得我 TM 为啥电子阳痿了；</p>
<p>以前玩游戏在没网的情况下，人会尽可能发挥主观能动性钻研出自己的绝招和攻略，形成一个硬核的玩家群体，现在的游戏则是尽可能的缩小可能性，让大多数玩家在有限的设定里去尽可能充值。玩家还会丧失主动感。</p>
<p>所以什么样的游戏才不会阳痿呢？我细数了一下我自己还经常玩的，类似 Civ，Rimworld，Mount n' Blade 这种，简单机制但是有无穷组合可能性的；GTA、少女卷轴这种开放世界的；Valheim，Minecraft 这种能造独一无二的东西装逼的。它们的共同特点就是缓解或者解决了我上面提到的种种问题。</p></p>

              <h2 class="card-title">开源 和 Meritocracy</h2>
            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>前几天跟人闲聊到国际纠纷和就业形势，聊到各行各业疲惫，然后转进到为啥互联网和软件行业比较和国际接轨。大家基本意见都是开源运动和 Open-source Software 在这里面功不可没。毕竟Linux没来之前 WPS 就被 MS Office 干了下去，民族软件面对几亿美刀研发费用的商业软件研发集团究竟是独木难支。</p>
<p>突然想到一个架空场景，如果某一天，老美突然发功，使得大陆大陆无法可靠获得某一版本号之后的所有开源软件，会发生什么？</p>
<p>当然，有人马上会说，国内大神会跟上进度的。比如国家可以安排一系列课题让一堆博士维护开源项目。的确，中国人和中国公司参与了很多<a href="/201906/stdout-003">open source project</a>，国内也有 <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">工信部支持</a>的gitee 和 <a href="https://gitlab.cn/">极狐Gitlab</a>，资金方面也有 <a href="http://license.coscl.org.cn/">木兰协议</a> 、<a href="https://www.openatom.org/">开放原子基金会</a>(民政部注册)，有人说如果都到了撕破脸禁用开源软件了，那么就真脱钩了，也不用管那么多直接拿来用就是了。</p>
<p>甚至有人说，其实开源都留了后手，比如Facebook 的 React，协议里也埋坑说，有权禁止竞争对手使用，最终解释权归他们。其实说起 Facebook(现称meta)，<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/65491011/answer/2700413148">最新的消息</a>是：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>他知道带有专利条款的许可迟早会在开源社区引爆负面讨论，他跟法务部门负责开源项目许可的律师沟通，但对方就是坚持为了保护公司利益必须要这样做。等到开源社区开始重视这件事情的时候，他找基础架构部门的副总裁也就是他顶上的大老板寻求帮助，结果副总裁跟双方开了个会之后选择站在律师那边，「你看人家律师的专业建议是这样子，你就照着做吧」。过了几个月，这个律师离职了，法务部门指派了另一个律师负责这件事情。前端平台部门的总监又跑去跟新的律师说要换 MIT 协议，结果新的律师完全没有尝试拒绝，「你们爱换就换吧，我觉得没问题」。然后就变成 MIT 协议了……</p>
</blockquote>
<p>回到开源本身这个话题，假设一个场景，如果在某个时刻，比如Chromium V20的时候，国内不能继续跟进最新版本，假设需要独立改进，需要花多少力气才能把H.264、CSS3、H5、WebRTC 等等一大堆新玩意补齐？如果你只能拿到 2.6 的 Kernel 代码，那么你如何才能魔改出来一个  5.10 的内核？</p>
<p>就算天降猛人，把这个事儿做到了，但是如果天降了3个猛人，小米搞了一套，华为搞了另一套，Oppo 搞了第三套，相互不兼容，又怎么办？比如苏联也有自己的一套完整的基于电子管的软硬件系统一样。</p>
<p>国内独立搞出来的项目，其实也有，比如 统一推送联盟</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/2022/stderr-09-01.webp" /></p>
<p>从 <a href="https://www.huxiu.com/article/640522.html">huxiu</a>、<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/439729608">zhihu</a> 的键盘分析师的观点来看，凉凉。。。甚至<a href="https://36kr.com/p/1880989350055297">连官网都没了</a></p>
<p>再比如，腾讯自己搞一套小程序，阿里也搞一套，各个银行都有自己小程序，各个安卓ROM厂家也搞了个「快应用 quickapp.cn」，再比如广电花了<a href="https://www.birtv.com/aspcms/news/2015-8-3/2112.html">48+20亿</a>搞了地面波 DTMB+CMMB，其中就有一项对口 MPEG-4 的<a href="http://www.avs.org.cn/aboutus.asp">AVS1</a> 视频编码格式，如果每个手机厂家相机app拍摄出来的格式互不兼容，快手抖音的视频上传和CDN转码会不会搞得巨复杂？</p>
<p>其实开源项目世界里，各个 contributor 各怀鬼胎把项目往不同的方向上拉扯，国外的例子也很多，比如最近 CMGS 写的《<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/W_9XYkF5Y_-M-aLdB-b_Ng">How k8s Fucked</a>》</p>
<p>写到这里，我突然想明白，开源软件的利害之处，除了技术可以不断被人推动进步，还有一个重要的就是「社区」和「方向」</p>
<p>这个是个很主观的东西，Firefox 也开源，比 Google 更标准，但是就是玩不过 Chromium。Linux为啥就能比BSD更流行？pg各方面都更先进，但是MySQL占有率就是更高。这里面的确有各种机缘巧合，以及金钱的因素，但是社区氛围和恰当的目标才是最重要的。个人觉得，如果国内独立做开源，问题可能不在于技术，而是朝一个方向齐心协力推动的氛围。</p>
<p>这个推演结论，突然让我想起了之前看到 princeton.edu 的一篇雄文：<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/a-belief-in-meritocracy-is-not-only-false-its-bad-for-you">A belief in meritocracy is not only false: it’s bad for you</a></p>
<p>英语单词 meritocracy 字面上看它好像是「美德主义」，经常被翻译成「精英领导」，，其实这没把内涵翻译出来，这词的本意是「谁有本事谁厉害」</p>
<blockquote>
<p>government or the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability</p>
</blockquote>
<p>从直觉上来说，能者上有啥问题？在开源软件来说，很多都是项目发起人，或者技术最厉害的人主导一个项目。我觉得这就是很典型的 meritocracy。这篇文章其实点明了几个 meritocracy 的问题：</p>
<ol>
<li>一个人的成就或者成功，往往是运气。所谓风口来了，吹起来了一堆猪</li>
<li>天份，和努力程度，往往是运气选中了那颗喜欢努力的精子，所以由遗传和抚养环境决定。</li>
<li>meritocracy 最终会导致一个人自私，或者说自负。</li>
</ol>
<p>当然这文章也藏了私货。meritocracy不好？gratitude 才好。要感恩！嗯最后估计说人人都有 sin 了。。。2333。其实 meritocracy 这矛盾在中国哲学看来很容易破解，侠之大者，为国为民。最高的能力，就是帮助他人的能力。</p>
<p>开源运动也是这样，最高的能力，就是他利用欧美成熟而刚性的版权制度，传染性的去传播自由。这是他超越软件工程能力最伟大的地方。</p>
<p>（完）</p>

<p>后记：最近才了解的知识，GPL是<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.zh-cn.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic">允许</a>修改、使用源码并且不公开源码的。前提是你不公开。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPL不要求你发布你的修改版或者任何一部分修改版。你有自由修改并自用，而不必发布。这个规则也适用于机构（包括公司）；机构可以做出修改版并在内部使用而不向其他外部组织发布。<br />
但是如果你以某种方式把修改版向公众发布，GPL就要求你向用户提供修改版的源代码。<br />
在公司内部使用只是公司为自己制作拷贝。因此，公司或组织可以开发自己的修改版并在内部部署，其员工也无权对外发布。<br />
然而，当公司把拷贝发送给其他组织或个人时，就是发布。具体来说，为合同商提供拷贝来离岸使用就是发布。</p>

            <p class="card-text"><p>今天 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32823472">HN 上</a>有个讨论 tailwind /open-props<br />
的帖子，发现这个20后所谓「woke」 科技公司的美术风格有个名字</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Completely off topic, but what is the art style that all woke companies like Google/Facebook etc use called?<br />

<p>翻了下 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Memphis">wikipedia</a> 最早可以追溯到2017年 Facebook 找 Buck Studios 外包设计的一个风格套件 facebook-alegria。孟菲斯名字和风格来自于意大利设计师 Ettore Sottsass 在80年代的设计厂 Memphis Group 。</p>
<p>Corporate memphis 的别称：</p>
<ul>
<li>Alegria style 快乐风 （alegria是西、葡、意语里joy的意思）</li>
<li>Globohomo 全球搞基</li>
<li>Big Tech art style 大厂风范</li>

<p>国内有对这种风格的报道比如 <a href="http://fashion.sina.com.cn/luxury/de/2018-09-09/0827/doc-ihiixyeu4453522.shtml">sina</a></p>

            <p class="card-text"><p>今天看娃的英语资料的时候，发现材料说什么什么  Taiwan question。当时就觉得奇怪，台湾什么时候变成一个题目了？</p>
<p>突然想起来，这好像是「台湾问题」的蹩脚翻译。</p>
<p>网上搜了一圈，发现大部分这个词汇都出自简中和官方媒体。哎。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/2022/stderr-08-01.webp" /></p>
<p>其中居然有一个 Hoover Institution 也用了这个词汇？好奇点了进去，作者是 Edward N. Luttwak 是个老外，然后第一段：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dividing the Taiwan question––does or should, and, if so, does America currently possess the wherewithal to help Taiwan successfully repel a Chinese attack</p>
</blockquote>
<p>好吧，别人真的是在说 how to help taiwan 这个 question。</p>
<p>还有发现一个问题是，「一个中国原则」在中文的表述是 one-China principle，但是美方的描述是</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the United States acknowledges that Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China</p>
</blockquote>
<p>这句话其实玩笑开的很大，美方只是 acknowledge 「知晓」有这回事，但是它并没有说支持或者反对这件事，甚至保留了去挑战甚至推翻这个事的权力。</p></p>

              <h2 class="card-title">大范围螺旋向下</h2>
            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>看到微博上一段话，出处已经找不到了</p>
<blockquote>
<p>以我观察，微博上不少博主正渐入一种沉默状态，即发博频率越来越低，之前一天发好几条，现在几天才发一条，更有人干脆弃号而去，我想，这种大范围螺旋向下的沉默是因为越来越多的人发现，自己其实生活在一个“魔法”世界。<br />
在这个魔法世界，很多事物在物理本体之上，还附着一层无形之力，只要念出相应的咒语，就能把这股力量召唤出来为己所用。<br />
比如，知乎上有一个问题是“你越来越沉默的原因是什么？” 其下的一位网友Seasee Youl的答案得到了24.8万的赞同，在文章中他写了几个自己的见闻，其一是在某商场的儿童乐园里，一个大爷怒斥年轻服务员，称其卖国，不配做中国人，还要打电话查封乐园，理由是乐园海洋球池的四周贴了英国国旗壁纸（大爷还认错了），答主见周围人在起哄附和，服务员委屈得直哭，就上前劝阻，但同样被训了一顿，说答主也是没有是非观念的人，在战争年代肯定要通敌，事后，答主才从服务员那得知，这大爷本是想让自己的孩子免费玩，被服务员拒绝后还价也没成，才有了之前上纲上线的一幕。<br />
这就是我说的魔法，只要念出一些特定的“咒语”，就能召唤出区区几张壁纸之上的那股无形力量，打压伤害别人，迫使别人屈服。<br />
类似的事，我也听身边人说过，小时候我家住大院筒子楼，有两户邻居关系紧张，见面都不说话，我问为啥，楼下大妈就说，很久以前，80年代的时候，两户人家因为楼道里的杂物堆放问题发生口角，吵着吵着就开始上纲上线，其中一位大爷指着对面青年的大腿说：“你看你穿的这个叫什么东西？！牛仔裤是西方资产阶级国家的东西！你就是思想被西方个人主义腐化了才这么自私！” 那青年也不甘示弱，马上回嘴道：“牛仔裤是当年西部淘金工人穿的裤子，是工人阶级的服装！你对工人阶级的服装不满，就是对工人阶级不满！就是对工人阶级领导的国家不满！” 双方就这样越吵越激动，脸红脖子粗地声讨彼此的“罪行”，最后还动起手，被邻居们劝阻后，两户人家再也不相往来，至于问题本身，自然也没解决。<br />
大妈当年复述这段往事，本是将其视作一个荒唐的笑话，但我如今回想时，眼前分明出现了两个对峙的巫师，他们同时嘴里叽里呱啦地念念有词，就是为了从一条牛仔裤里召唤出天雷地火灭了对方。<br />
我想，这就是人们渐渐不语的原因，现在说一句话，要考虑的不仅仅是那句话本身，还要考虑那句话所有可能被解读的角度，以及作者本人都未曾想到的“言外之意”，自己不经意间的某句话一旦被施了咒，召唤出了字面之上的那股无形之力，那就少不了一番应对招架。<br />
表达的风险和成本越高，人们就越是沉默。<br />
事实上，如果任由这种无限解读的咒语在生活中漫流，那所有人都将生活在惶恐之中，不要幻想自己是这股力量的主宰，毕竟咒语千千万，也总有几句适用于你。<br />
老话说的好，“玩剑者必死于剑下”，其实，玩魔法的人也是一样。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>恰好最近看到一个国外的例子 红牛F1 的青训车手 Vips 因为在直播打游戏的时候骂了嘴 N-word ，就<a href="https://twitter.com/redbullracing/status/1541813680840609792">被 cancel 了</a>，国内的例子就是 冈本六君子</p>

<p>Bitbucket 每个月有50分钟的免费pipeline 时间，自己用下来差不多29秒 build &amp; publish 一次。感觉每个月也写不了60篇，所以目前是够了。</p>
<p>接下来的优化：</p>

<li>新图片通过 squoosh 压缩优化</li>
<li>通过 cloudflare worker 替换掉 disqus 评论功能</li>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>今天菜鸟给我推了好几条消息说有快递24h未取，但是近期并没有网购下单，仔细问了一圈，原来是岳母在老家自己买了条裤子。这是让我很震惊的。因为岳母并不识得很多字，在过去经验看来独立完成网上购物是一个高门槛的事。</p>
<p>2010年以前网购的人，至少得有信用卡，在遍地只有存折的年代把大多数人挡在门外。</p>
<p>再后面就是开通银行卡，其实银行卡普及也就最近几年的事。以前要开卡还是很麻烦的。办U盾这种就拦住了大多数没有PC的家庭，甚至还发展出了在便利店代充值支付宝这种神奇的业务。</p>
<p>但无论如何，要网购，你至少应该会输入法和搜索；即便在手机上用语音输入，在眼花缭乱的商品列表页面，或者SERP里挑选和对比自己想要的东西，也是相当麻烦的，需要一定经验的，甚至需要交学费。</p>
<p>但是现在回到原点思考一下，带着目的去购物，其实是一种很直男的做法。</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/2022/stderr-07-01" /></p>
<p>像我这种old-school的看参数，比价格，蹲活动，薅羊毛，拆单，7天无理由的人，恐怕会成为少数群体。</p>
<p>只要你确定了支付方式，收货地点，那么这就是一个长期的过程。你甚至不需要识字和写字，就能完成一次愉快的消费。网购只有零次和无数次。</p>
<p>最近家里人也在看《东方甄选》，怎么说呢，举个例子，让你选一套儿童绘本，你可能需要翻很多自媒体、公众号才能得知一套叫《神奇校车大家族》的。但是如果你关注对了一个直播间，可能就是一次神奇的偶遇了。突然想到马督工在 睡前消息88《<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ZE411G7zT/">快手网红给武汉捐款1亿，这是“中国小贩”的究极形态了</a>》 讲过当年的快手一哥辛有志（李佳琪第八，最近因春夏之交五队轮蛋糕被封那个），他的分析是，辛有志就好比以前北方农村有这种赶集里吆喝的商品贩子，利用运输成本(比如串货)和信息差来赚快钱，只能骗「没有信息搜索能力的网民」。当时看的时候没觉得这有啥问题，现在我觉得这里面玄机可大了。</p>
<ol>
<li>可能的确有一部分人因教育程度(2021七普全国文盲37,750,200人)，技能培训缺失，是永远无法具备搜索能力的；或者app的搜索结果就很垃圾（比如天猫直通车这种操纵行为）；或者主观上觉得搜索不好用、懒得用；</li>
<li>随便逛逛是大多数人的生活心态。特别是现代社会，商品整体是供大于求的。在欠缺年代，人们对购买是有很强的目的性和功利性的。现在可能散心的意义更大。</li>
<li>人们购物普遍是无法区分 want 和 need 的。看直播、划短视频会极大占据空闲时间。</li>
<li>找准购买目标一次性解决的直男式是不可持续的，现在的购物已经不再是狩猎时代了。</li>
</ol>
<p>以「搜索」为核心的购物，有一个根本性的缺陷，有些东西不知道搜什么关键词好，比如我家厨房垃圾处理器和洗碗机连接头，没专用名字的东西，你是没法搜的。搜索购物必须是已知的。也就是说他面向的是一个存量的商品，货架上现成的。但是这个世界创新又往往发生在边界。甚至有些东西不是你想搜就能搜的，比如究竟什么款式和颜色的衣服更适合特定形体的观众？这个东西是无法用「关键词」描述的。关键词是离散的，而人的需求是平滑连续的。</p>
<p>如果你是个带货主播，那么长期来看，个人品味可能会决定生存和人气。或许渠道的价值要大于品牌本身的价值了？比如穿搭这一块，很可能会是视频导购的基本盘，细分市场被几个头部主播把持。然而这一点很矛盾的是，穿着是一件很个性的事，撞衫这种事见光死。有一点可以确定的是，有一些 niche market 应该会积累一大批忠实观众。比如车评人、手机圈、PC圈、相机圈、美妆圈等。</p>
<p>直播带货虽然谈不上什么大创造发明，但这种方式恐怕会在将来统治这个时代。或者说将来很长一段时间，在解决了如何上手和如何配送的问题后，很多人购物的习惯可能会以直播/小视频为主了。</p></p>
