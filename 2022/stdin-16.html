  <p>今天在看到<a href="https://www.solidot.org/story?sid=73284">有人发</a>了个《男性觉醒知识库》觉得太荒唐了。然后就看到<a href="https://v2ex.com/t/893244">评论区</a>有人贴了个《教姐妹们如何要彩礼》更无语。。出处未知，作者未知。请选择性食用。</p>

<h1>Bride Dowry Guide for Fellow Sisters 教姐妹们如何要彩礼</h1>
<p>The proletarian mentor Friedrich Engels said in <em>Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pairing family, also known as monogamous marriage, originates from private ownership. It is characterized by the male subjugation of the female in gender relations, the disappearance of the female from public life and her forced return to the family, as well as by the denial of sexual freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feminist theory holds that "marriage is essentially a form of male exploitation of women, an oppression of the powerful by the vulnerable." Combined with our extensive practice in real life, it is easy to see that many women are deprived of their birth rights, education rights, employment rights, etc. for various reasons. But those with vested interests are never satisfied and are further infringing on the rights of their sisters. Since there is too much content, I will not expand here, but only briefly discuss how sisters can protect their rights in marriage.</p>
<p>When sisters get married, they always encounter confusion: How do you want the bride dowry? How can I make my husband's family pay attention to it and not be a sufferer in the past? How to buy gold jewelry? How to get added to the ownership of the house, etc. all kinds of problems plagued the sisters to be married, today the author through this article one-stop solution to the sisters on the wedding trouble.</p>
<p>Glossory:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bride dowry</code> 彩礼</li>
<li><code>mama's boy</code> 妈宝男</li>
<li><code>ugly duckling</code> 凤凰男</li>
</ul>
<h2>I. Choosing a partner</h2>
<p>Marriage is a big deal, is the second birth of our women, so how to choose a reliable marriage object is the key to the key.</p>
<p>On the marriage, especially the far marriage, I have heard a very apt statement: "far marriage, means that if the male noon to make you angry, the night your father's ear can not slap him in the face, that belongs to the far marriage." Sisters can give priority to this principle when selecting a marriage partner.</p>
<p>The following details about how to choose a marriage partner.</p>
<h3>(A) the classification of men</h3>
<p>Contemporary Chinese men are generally of worst quality. Lazy, shy, greasy, obscene, no taste of life, no aesthetics, no formality, and even many are <strong>mama's boy</strong>. Therefore, sisters must be extra cautious when looking for a marriage partner, you may want to date several at the same time, the best of the best, after all, in nature only the strongest males are qualified to mate and reproduce. The most important thing is to find a quality genetic provider for your children, even for the sake of the next generation. In this case, I will be divided into three categories of men: quality men, Phoenix men and ordinary men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quality Male: refers to the height of 180cm-185cm, parents working in business or the government, physically healthy &amp; with a pension plan, at least two loan-free property registered in Tier-I cities (Beijing, Shanghai, GuangZhou, Shenzhen), liquidity of not less than 3 million RMB, annual income of not less than 50,000 RMB, a master's degree or above men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ugly Duckling: a man who meets any four of the requirements for a "Quality Male".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ordinary Male: a man who meets any two of the requirements of a "Quality Male".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creatures: Not recommended. Don't bother to contact anyone below the standard of the Ordinary Male</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>(B) Mate Selection Strategy</h3>
<p>THe Quality Male are one-in-a-million chance. Grab it while you can and never let go. If you are losing it, get pregnant and make him a daddy. The sooner you gets this the better, the winner takes all.</p>
<p>For Ugly Ducklings, dating two or more at the same time, choice the best. Prioritize a handsome tall one, after all, the good looking bores your less in future days.</p>
<p>For Ordinary Male, you can consider use a "spare tire", "male BFF" strategy, just in case you meet a Ugly Duckling or a Quality Male is a jerk, then at least a guaranteed option, this type of man is best limited at 3-5, too many too busy. Give them an above-friendship but not-yet-lovers state, do not let them easily get you.</p>
<p>Pay special attention: Be wary of Mama's Boy! Be wary of Mama's Boy! Be wary of Mama's Boy!. Because Mama's Boy's money = his mom's money ≠ your money, if you meet Mama's Boy, even if he is Quality Male, don't engage. In order to identify Mama's Boy, trust your sixth sense, when you assume a man is a Mama's Boy, then he must be.</p>
<h2>II. Marriage Preparation</h2>
<h3>(A) Tame men</h3>
<p>Warning: the following strategies do not apply to Quality Male, Quality Male are OK as long as they are not Mama's Boy, not alcoholic, no gambling, no domestic violence, no prostitution, everything else is acceptable.</p>
<p>Please sisters remember the phrase: "Never marry a man who do not kneel down to wash the feet". In the dating stage, no matter what our own character is, we have to make a cool and poker face. This will give the man to form a psychological expectation that he needs to pay desperately more to cater to your approval. But you can not be too cool, give back little sweetness to warm his confidence, make him feel that you are unreachable, to maintain a status of near-approchable.</p>
<p>Tactic one: for example, he invited you to dinner, buy him a milk tea in return; he invited you to an amusement park or bar, you can send him a keychain, plush toys and other small gifts.</p>
<p>Second tactic: deliberately throw some tantrum but not too excessive, make him argue, and then you pretend to be angry, blacklist his contact, wait for him to apologize &amp; ask forgiveness</p>
<p>Third tactic: occasionally care about his parents, let him think you tender and considerate, and then take him to see your parents (he can not go empty-handed), giving him a feeling that you have taken him as family.</p>
<p>In conclusion: men are a very naive creature, they are easily touched by your small guestures, to imaging you are the true love. So you have to learn to play small to game big, giving a little to increase the man to your niceness. Taming men should be like taming dogs, to be rigid and soft, only then they can be controlled to the direction you want. But remember not to over doing it, that will swing men away, unless you really wanted to, or want to force him to do something silly. Don't believe the honesty, too much pressure will only make the crack. Of course, you can not be too soft, then you will lose.</p>
<h3>(B) Manipulate the man</h3>
<p>After you have tamed the man, basically the man has been obedient to you. This is the time you have to decisively seize his salary card, bank card, the reason is afraid that he would waste money, you have to plan for the future life. This time the man will feel that you are right, and will think that you are really thinking about your future.</p>
<p>After the economy grab, you'd gave him some weekly allowances. Give more if you are happy, less if not. But do not spent all the money as this belongs to the premarital property, you are at most considered the keeper. Refrain to spend after marriage.</p>
<p>You can take the money to invest at funds or something, he will be too shy to ask for the profits, instead he will praise your housekeeping skills.</p>
<p>Tighten the economic control gradually, and crack down his private savings. For example, if for three months in a row you give him 1000 yuan pocket money he does not complain, he even gifts you sometimes, then it is recommended to drop to 800 yuan in the begining of the fourth month. Maintain a level just enough for his spendings. After all, the more he spends, the less you get.</p>
<p>If he questions this behavior, you will show him the financial gains to shut him up, if necessary, you can send friends or friends in common to pressure him, of course, do not forget to let your BFF to play: "My boyfriend only need 500 yuan a month pocket money, you got 800 that's really quite a lot."</p>
<p>After mastering the man's economic lifeline, you have to occasionally spend your money, note that it is your money not his, buy his parents some gifts. This generation of men's parents are very easy to handle, they are still very simple-minded, or the kind of "male dominant business female dominant family" or "a good daughter-in-law to prosper three generations" of mental. Give them an image of you as a "good daughter-in-law" and let them put pressure the man so you can get married soon.</p>
<p>(The following chapters are not reviewed, translated by DeepL entirely)</p>
<h2>III. Marriage Negotiations</h2>
<p>Once you start preparing for marriage, then you will inevitably avoid talking about the bride dowry, dowry and other issues. Because of your previous operation to please his parents, at this time in the bride dowry just ask, the male parents will be generous, they are eager to hurry to marry you into the door. First of all, the gold, some places to get married to "hardware", some places to "three gold", but no matter how many gold, my advice is to stop. Because this thing is not worn every day, and to buy back after the realization of the discount, it is too much of a loss, it is better to focus on more bride dowry and house to add the name.</p>
<p>The amount of bride dowry according to the family's different circumstances to discuss one thing, in principle, not less than 200,000. The house name is also naturally added, the author will not go into details, but the author is interested in talking about the bride dowry related words and notes. The following tactics are of course also applicable:</p>
<h3>1. the attitude card</h3>
<p>The actual fact is that you will not be able to get a good deal on a lot of the things you need to do. If the man and you bargain, you will accuse him of having an attitude problem, and then bring out your friend so-and-so, saying that she asked for XX bride dowry, gave birth to two sons to the man's family, and is now living happily. As for whether you have this friend, they can not really go to test.</p>
<p>Note: If your object is a barbarian, saying that if you want attitude, then he will donate the money to charity in your name so that you can prove the attitude and do good, how meaningful. This means that he still does not want to give the bride dowry, such a stingy brain and bad men recommended to stay away.</p>
<h3>2. The Traditional card</h3>
<p>You insist on claiming that the bride dowry is just a custom in your hometown, your whole family is very traditional, so if you don't want it, your parents will lose face in your hometown, and your hometown is basically the price is not negotiable. This method can be used in combination with the "attitude method" for better results. Finally, it can be upgraded to "Do you really love me?" The "Are you trying to cheat on me?" is a soul-crushing question.</p>
<p>Note: If you are more diverse and open in your daily life, have richer emotional experiences, are more skilled in sex, and are usually not so reserved, it is not recommended to use this method. For example, you often publish something like "Is it important to be a virgin? How is it a woman's duty to give birth to a child and take care of the household? The Qing Dynasty is dead!" and so on. Then give him the "traditional customs, our place are like this", it is easy for him to begin to smart IQ and start to reoccupy the high ground.</p>
<h3>3. Compensation card</h3>
<p>You insist that the child is born for the man, the bride dowry is the compensation for the woman's hardships in childbirth, after all, childbirth will seriously affect your career, you had the opportunity to become a million million or even billionaires by their own efforts, the result is that because of the child's career setbacks have to make a monthly salary of 3,000 do not do. At the same time, your body is greatly affected by the birth of a child, there are sequelae, so you must ask for compensation.</p>
<p>Note: To examine the IQ of a good man after selective use of this method. Some men will be thankful for your dedication after hearing you say that having a child is not easy. The actual fact is that you will be able to get a lot more than just a few of these. And if the man is a little bit more sophisticated, he will think: since you say it is for me, then we do not even need to get a marriage license, you give me the baby, I give you the money and we are clear? Or he will discuss the price of surrogacy with you and think that we should go to the mother and keep the child. Sisters, believe me, such a man must not be married. If you marry, you will also have a day of divorce.</p>
<p>Remember, if you divorce a man, you must claim custody of the child, because it is your child, and with the child you can ask him for alimony and succession rights!</p>
<h3>4. Value card</h3>
<p>This type of method is applicable to sisters who are outstanding in appearance and assets. "I'm so good, I'm not worth this much bride dowry?" "I don't care if you have this kind of money?" You should express your disdain for this bride dowry with an attitude of deep dislike, as well as the posture of "love to marry or not". But do not forget, after the marriage your money is your money, his money or your money, soft hearted to men is hard hearted to themselves. Li Xueqin also said: "Women should be more heartbroken themselves, heartbroken men unlucky for life." So never heart the male.</p>
<p>Note: If the other side is more shaft, such methods are easy to roll over.</p>
<h3>5. The Binding card</h3>
<p>This method is suitable for sisters who have been dating men for a long time. "I have been with you for so long, my youth is not worth this money?" "Do you love me or do you love money?" "You really love me if this money can not get out?" This is the bride dowry and their time, youth, feelings of payment tied to force him to be obedient. Men are very reflective creatures, they will always feel that it is not their own problem, is not their own stingy, so when you use this method to use appropriate cold violence, such as watching him cry and then do not speak, call his parents to tell them that they can not call their parents, or directly to him to say no more. Don't be afraid to use your feelings to blackmail him, because he can't find anyone better than you because of your previous good behavior. The people around him usually come back to persuade him at this time, and most likely his parents will start scolding him.</p>
<p>Note: Pay attention to cultivate his ability to reflect at first, do not let him to "my youth is not youth?" "Do I pay less than you?" Such direction. This method is suitable for men who have been tamed for a long time.</p>
<h3>6. The "Assurance" method</h3>
<p>When the man thinks the bride dowry is too high, you have to tell him the reason why you want the bride dowry: "I don't want the bride dowry, I just want a guarantee." "I can't take care of my parents if I marry you, so I have to leave some money for my parents." "I'm not very secure, I'm afraid of being hurt in marriage, I just want a guarantee." "My father raised me for so many years and paid for my education, so what's wrong with asking for a dowry?" No matter what happens later, first get the bride dowry. After you get it, you can then talk to him about gender equality, your family is only one child you also have to bear the responsibility of parental care. This time the man generally admitted.</p>
<p>Note: If your family conditions are better, this statement will be a bit funny, it is recommended that the sisters married far away or family conditions are not flexible use.</p>
<h3>7. double act method</h3>
<p>Double reed method is a singing white face, a singing red face. You do not say anything just prepare for marriage, the bad guys by your parents to do, the conditions by your parents to mention. Your parents use the first 6 methods to negotiate with the man, the key moment you pull back a little on the line. This strategy is the best strategy, one is to avoid direct conflict between you and the man's family, on the other hand, can also make the man bear your feelings, you talk tough.</p>
<p>The most important thing to note: some men will have more eyes, think that marriage is a matter of two families, you are pretending to be good. This is a good way to keep the image of a good girl, and usually have no opinion of the "little girl" type of sister.</p>
<p>Please use the above methods when talking about the bride dowry, the effect is better. Some people may feel that the above methods are full of calculations, then I have to tell you, our criminal psychology expert Professor Li Meijin said: "The biggest payoff for women is pregnancy, and their womb is another kind of property. And then there is breastfeeding, where women are mothers who directly produce the most precious food. For this reason, men provide property, provide funds to support the family, this is the will of God, break this contract, there will be retribution ......".</p>
<h2>III. The wedding</h2>
<p>There is nothing to say about the marriage process, according to your idea, the man pays is up. Remember that the wedding day must not test the man too much, so that he can not stand, because although he gave the bride price, but the heart will be more or less uncomfortable. And men are generally good face, they can use the money for face, you just use their face for money. Let him first send the red envelope in advance, sent in place, the process of receiving a slight test can be, do not screw up their wedding.</p>
<h2>IV. THe married life and divorce</h2>
<p>As already said in the previous article, marriage is the second birth of our women, we may not be born into a good family at the beginning, but can rely on marriage to live a good life. A friend of the author once said to me that marriage itself is a transaction. We women can take out some false head things in marriage, such as the right to the name, family, paternal rights and so on in exchange for real money. This matter is originally the heart to calculate the heart, more heart to calculate the heart, so I suggest that the sisters do not care what the right to the name, are you born children, can not be your? But these can be used as a bargaining chip, do not let him get so easily.</p>
<p>According to China's judicial practice, generally divorce a year after marriage, the bride price is awarded to the woman as joint property after the marriage or as a gift arising from the marriage. The dowry is characterized as the woman's pre-marital property. Therefore, even if your husband is not satisfied later, you'd better insist on more than one year.</p>
<p>According to our judicial practice, even if a woman cheats in marriage and has a child that is not her husband's own, the child is to be raised by the man as a legitimate child. Still according to our judicial practice, even if the man bought the house before marriage is his full payment, but added your name, you are able to divide a certain percentage.</p>
<p>Still according to China's judicial practice, in some areas, "cheating within marriage, the agreed property all to the party not at fault" prenuptial agreement is recognized by the judge. So I suggest that sisters before marriage must be a good study of marriage law, find a lawyer to do a good job consulting, sign a good prenuptial agreement, as to whether the other party will cheat, to believe that men are unable to withstand temptation, this can not say too much detail, there are many ways, in order to the harmony of the family I can only point to the end.</p>
<p>When divorce must pay attention to emphasize that the male party has domestic violence, alcoholism, gambling and other vices. In daily life to pay attention to retain the evidence, some of the small things he upset you to expand, and then force him to apologize, let him sign a guarantee. Don't underestimate these warranties, they are recognized by the court in case of a lawsuit.</p>
<p>In the case of domestic violence, it is important to remember that even if you have not been abused, you should take pictures of your usual injuries for other reasons as evidence of domestic violence. It is the other party's business to clarify and the lawyer's business to argue, so you are responsible for providing all kinds of evidence that can be.</p>
<p>The most important point is that you should try to find a female judge for your divorce case! Because only female judges will help women, only girls will help girls!</p>
<p>V. Conclusion</p>
<p>To believe in the state, believe in the law. The state can't wait for every man to get married, because there is no family bondage of men is not controlled, is the social instability. Sisters to have confidence, encounter things dare to make trouble, whether it is microblogging, friends, the court or the other work unit, as long as you dare to make trouble, in most cases the other party will compromise.</p>
<p>Sisters, you must believe in your own power, protect yourself, and be an independent and excellent woman, valiant.</p>
