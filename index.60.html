<p>从中可以看出sitcom的秘密，comedies are all about pacing and timing: laughter breaks.</p>

<p>可以看出，气氛是全靠渲染的。。。五毛的舆论引导其实就是一种气氛渲染。</p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>最近快被各个地方的网友逼疯了。。。都在问 <a href="http://initiative.yo2.cn/">initiative.yo2.cn</a> 这个blog怎么了。。。汗死。。。都不去看<a href="http://yo2.cn/20091224/">yo2.cn主页上的公告</a>么？其实任何 *.yo2.cn 都打不开好久了。</p>

<p>我现在才发现一个很神奇的事情，那就是好多人都是直接输入 initiative.yo2.cn 这个网址来访问我的blog的。。。很震惊。。。我的blog都值得直接记住域名了。。。大家太看起小弟了。。。。</p>

<p>这里提供一个围观yo2.cn遗迹的方法，还是编辑hosts文件</p>

<pre><code>60.29.250.75    initiative.yo2.cn
</code></pre>

<p>然后 <code>ipconfig /flushdns</code> 然后重启浏览器就可以看 yo2.cn 上的博客了。</p>

<p>那么blog也就[b]正式独立[/b]出来了。yo2.cn导出的Wordpress WXR有9MB大，import比较困难，所以就不准备搬家了，本地把内容和评论和附件存个档备份就行了。大家凑合着Google Cache和上面的hosts方法看吧。呵呵。</p>

<p>那么这里的blog也就准备开放Google索引和继续母语写作了。如果被河蟹了那只能说明不幸。。。。</p>

<p>hosting用的是Dreamhost的 $9 促销空间，域名也是今年7月份到期，到时候是否renew再看着办吧 :)</p>

<ul>
<li>6 cameras aimed in 360 degree spaced equally</li>
<li>There was one camera facing the sky, that helped correct light settings of other cameras to get a good shot.</li>
<li>They shot 30fps <strong>video</strong></li>
<li>the driver has a Monitor/Keyboard int the front, to stop, pause, mark wildlife on side of road (lots of deer, elk, etc), something scenic, points of interest.</li>
<li>Typical 7-10 hour a day would go through a <strong>1 Terabyte</strong> Hard Drive</li>
<li>The cars with the LARGE setups are the newer cameras. Under the camera, there are 3 white devices, one straight forward, and two to the sides. These are 3d imaging devices recording the <strong>shape</strong> of everything the car is going by.</li>
<li>Driver’s job is 75 unique miles per day. 40 hours per week but no weekends, getting $15 per hour</li>
<li>They only shot public highways and roads. No gravel roads (damage to camera from gravel kicking up), no private roads, no military roads, and no private property roads.</li>
<li>They don’t have a schedule, routes are random and up to driver for most part</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>the three codes or factors concern basic human fundamentals:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>how you physically interact with the object (how you hold it, kick it, twist it, etc.);</li>
  <li>how it is related to eating (biting, sipping, tasting, swallowing);</li>
  <li>how it is related to shelter or enclosure. </li>

<p>Regional = [ timezone | geo-region | language ]</p>

<p>which can be defined in</p>

<ul>
<li>browser settings, thus HTTP request headers</li>
<li>browser components, like <code>toLocaleDateString(), toLocaleTimeString, tolocaleLowerCase(), tolocaleUpperCase(), toLocaleString()</code> in Javascript, and any browser specific or vendor specific scriptable interface.</li>
<li>cookie</li>
<li>session</li>
<li>Flash cookie (aka LocalSharedObject)</li>
<li>URL (like <code>hl=zh_CN&amp;</code>)</li>
<li>profile website and product specific profile. Example in Google profile your language is English(US) while your in Google Calendar settings you choose English(UK)</li>
<li>target website ccTLD</li>
<li>DNS settings</li>
<li>third party data provision like oAuth or OpenID</li>
<li>IP address and other lower-level or higher-level network identifiers, most maliciously, RTT combined with a accurate route table</li>
<li>(to be added)</li>

<p>This is why making comparison and getting conclusions are <a href="http://www.google.org.cn/posts/google-only-have-10-search-results-on-china-ip.html">hard to be scientific complete and correct</a>.</p>

This is intended as an addendum to the existing 0day rules. All the old rules 
are still valid, unless they have been altered or updated by this addendum.

The 0day scene has gone through major changes in this decade. As technologies 
have changed, so have we, but our adaptations have left many grey areas in the 
current rules. The last rules update was years ago when programs were much 
smaller and transfer speeds much lower. The existing 0day rules did not address 
problems of software encountered today, simply because at that date it did not 
exist. These changes have led to a series of loopholes which groups have been 
taking advantage of. The new rules we constructed aim to close these loopholes,
as well as increase the general quality level of releases in the scene.

This document covers a new ruleset for 0day.  These rules and guidelines are
intended for release-groups in the first place, and sites secondary. We hope 
that in time many sites will take over the majority of these rules. The 
following groups have signed and committed to following these rules:

     ACME AiR AGAiN ALiAS ARN BACKLASH BEAN BLiZZARD BRD CORE CRD 
        CROSSFiRE DIGERATI DVT EMBRACE FALLEN FAS iNViSiBLE LND
             MESMERiZE NGEN NULL ORiON OUTLAWS RiTUEL ROGUE
                   SHOCK SSG TBE UNLEASHED VACE ZWT 

These rules will go into effect starting January 31st, 2010.

* Release Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[&lt;Developer.name&gt;.]&lt;Program.name&gt;.v&lt;Version&gt;[.&lt;Language&gt;][.&lt;OS&gt;][.&lt;CPU&gt;]
[.&lt;Release.Type&gt;][.&lt;Additional.Tags&gt;]-&lt;Groupname&gt;

Developer.Name is only mandatory if the application name is not unique enough
for duping. Groups should use some common sense to keep the directory name 
reasonable length.

The program name should be the &quot;official&quot; name of the application. Do not omit
dashes, think of your dupe results.

The Language tag must be used only on NON english releases. Multilingual and
bilingual are optional.

Currently valid OS tags are: 
        - Win98, WinME, WinNT, Win2k, WinXP, Win2k3, Vista, Win2k8, Win7
          (can have an optional tag for more specific edition)
        - [Distribution.]Linux
        - MacOSX
        - [Free|Net|Open]BSD
        - [Open]Solaris
        - AIX
        - HPUX
        - Open.Enterprise.Server (NetWare)

The Operating.System tag should be omitted when WinAll (= NT5 based windows 
and optionally earlier, always with latest official service pack). Using a 
UnixAll (= all of the operating systems above, excluding Windows, Linux or 
MacOSX) or a WinAll tag means your app *must* run on *all* of the operating 
systems that fall under it.

CPU should be omitted when x86, must be x64 for x86_64/EM64T, but not IA64!
Currently valid CPU tags are: 
        - x86, x64, IA64, PPC, SPARC, SPARC64, RISC, Alpha

Release.Type can be omitted for Crack/Regged, but is mandatory for keygen
releases. Possible tags are:
        - Keygen.Only Keymaker.Only
        - Incl.Keygen Incl.Keymaker
        - Incl.Keygen.and.Patch Incl.Keymaker.and.Patch
        - Cracked
        - Regged

Additional.Tags like READ.NFO, DIRFIX, NFOFIX.. must go as follows:
  - DevelopersName.ProgramName.v1.2.Regged.READ.NFO-GROUP
  - DevelopersName.ProgramName.v1.2.Regged.DIRFIX-GROUP

You can use underscores or dots as seperator in the releasename, but do not mix
them if there is no reason for it (e.g. a program name contains underscores and
your seperator is a dot is a valid reason to mix)

The lists in this section are by no means complete. They are here to serve as a
guideline for proper dirname construction.

* Packaging:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Filenames must be named up to a maximum of 8.3 characters (filename/extension).

Acceptable compression format at this time is any compression method that
supports multiple volumes and long file names, followed by the traditional
PKZIPing. Compressions other than RAR should include an extract utility or be a
self-extracting archive.

The traditional packaging methods (zip/diz) shall be maintained, with a diz 
file being present in each zip. The diz file should contain as a bare minimum 
the number of the current disk and the maximum number of disks. 

Suggested file_id.diz layout is as follows:
  [xx/??], where ?? is the total nr of disks in the release. The total number 
  of lines of your diz should not exceed 30.

On a side note: using ridiculous compressions that will save 10 disks but takes
10 hours to unpack are not an acceptable solution.

* Release Size:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Allowed split volume sizes are:
        - 1,444,000 bytes
        - 2,888,000 bytes
        - 5,000,000 bytes
        - 10,000,000 bytes
        - 50,000,000 bytes

The utils disk limit is as of now 70 x 5,000,000 bytes or 35 x 10,000,000 bytes. 
This equates to a total of 350,000,000 bytes of compressed data. Oversize 
releases are allowed when no ISO release exists and the group (or an iso group 
they work with) is not in possession of the iso to release. In other words, 
there is NO size limit for 0day apps, except when an iso exists!

The games disk limit is as of now 80 x 5,000,000 bytes or 40 x 10,000,000 bytes.
This equates to a total of 400,000,000 bytes of compressed data.

Any release should have less than 100 volumes. In case 10,000,000 bytes do not
suffice, you are allowed to use volumes of larger size; up to 50,000,000 bytes.

A size proper is valid when a group manages to reduce the size of the original 
release by at least 30% without sacrificing essential content:

 - Documentation, help files, and other non functional items can be ripped from 
   a release to decrease size. No functional parts of an application may be 
   ripped.
 - C++ redistributables, .NET framework, and other common operating system 
   components may be ripped. The nfo should note what has been ripped and 
   optionally include an url where it can be downloaded.
 - A documentation addon is only allowed if the documentation cannot be 
   downloaded freely and publicly (without registration) from the developer's 
   website.

* Specific Release Type:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of these releases should provide functionality identical to that of a fully
licensed copy.

- Cracked: The program file has been altered to register the program. Any 
  nags/trial limitations should be removed. Any remnants of &quot;Trial&quot; in the app
  need to be removed. Any &quot;phone-home&quot; checks should be disabled!

- Regged: Any way to make an application &quot;registered&quot; without requiring
  modification of any of the applications executables/libraries. Must include
  a text file with the required information, serials should not be put in the
  release nfo. Please name this file carefully, as to deter possible 
  webspiders looking for serial information.

- Keygen: A small standalone program which generates valid serials/keyfiles
  which are based on user input or hardware id.

  Keygens can be written in any language but they should be native executables
  for the OS the application is meant for: Linux keygens for Linux applications,
  Mac keygens for Mac applications, etc. This means that if you do not follow
  this suggestion, you could get propered. However, you won't be nuked if there
  is no native keygen available.

  A keygen that generates a system-dependant serial must explicitly warn the
  user of this fact, either in the nfo OR at runtime.

  Windows keygens in java are allowed if the the program is coded in java or 
  uses java. Same with any other interpreter language. If a library is included
  with the latest windows install, as is the case for VB6/.NET/VBScript 
  currently, then keygens written in these languages are allowed without 
  question. The motivation here is that a scene release should run on a clean
  OS install, introducing no additional dependencies other than those imposed
  by the application being released.

  A console-based application that usually runs on headless systems (servers, 
  etc) requires a console-based keygen.

  Generic Keygens (All.Products) are allowed and dupe full releases for as long
  as the generic keygen continues to work for *every* application it was
  intended for.

  Keygen.Only releases are releases that only contain the actual keygen, no
  installation files. They are meant as an addition to previous Crack/Regged
  releases. 

  A Keygen.and.Patch release combines a keygen with a crack to enable full
  functionality. You are still allowed to release a keygen.only for these
  releases.

- Retail: A store-bought supply is included in this release. You are allowed to
  release a retail after a previous release if there is an added benefit to
  using the retail version. In this case you are required to add a READ.NFO tag
  to your dirname and list the benefits when compared to the previous release.

- PROPER/WORKING: a proper of a previous scene-release that was not fully 
  working should always include adequate proof and information for nukers to 
  test and confirm the validity of the proper. This means including screenshots,
  pieces of code, or clear steps to reproduce the problems that occur with
  the release you are propering.

- READ.NFO: If you label a release READ.NFO, please have a clearly stated 
  section in your nfo on what the READ.NFO is all about, dont make people guess.
  If you want people to read it for a certain reason, make sure they can.


* Operating Systems:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a developer has not mentioned default or minimum requirements for operating
system, the default is Windows XP, which is also a minimum.

If a program supports Windows Operating Systems before WinXP, then your crack
*should* work on them aswell.

Optional: combine multiple operating system versions for the same CPU in 1 
release if it remains within size limits, for example:
- FreeBSD5,6,7 x86 can be in a single release tagged FreeBSD
If the installers are freely downloadable (available without registration) and 
the same keygen/crack works for every version, consider only including the 
latest version of the OS.

Please keep in mind that the contents of .tar.gz, .rpm, .deb and any other
packaging system are generally identical. Please make a note in your nfo in
case of exceptions.

* Minor Updates:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MU stands for Minor Update. This term denotes an update of a previously 
released application within a certain time-period, the MU-period. Major updates
are allowed regardless of the last time a previous version was released. In
this case, the nfo should include some motivation for considering this a major
update (security- and stability-critical hotfixes for instance)

MU-period of 1 month, disregarding the number of days in a month. Examples:

- a release on 2010-01-01 will be out of mu on 2010-02-01
- a release on 2010-01-15 will be out of mu on 2010-02-15
- a release on 2010-01-29 will be out of mu on 2010-02-28
- a release on 2010-01-31 will be out of mu on 2010-02-28
- a release on 2010-02-28 will be out of mu on 2010-03-28
- a release on 2010-03-31 will be out of mu on 2010-04-30

This ensures no more than a single release of the same application per month,
while keeping duping simple. 

The minor update period is counted from the last valid release which contained 
the software itself. In other words, keymaker.only releases are not considered.

* General Rules:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- If the age of the last modified file of an installed program is older than 
  one (1) year it is not allowed to pre it without a READ.NFO or INTERNAL tag.

- A group should release the newest version of the software available.

  Exceptions are possible when the software is not available publicly, or if
  it was never released before, which *must* be mentioned in the nfo-file. 
  This means you can release an older version of an application, but *only* if 
  it is newer than any existing release of the same app, and you have a valid
  reason for not releasing the latest version (for instance, it is very hard
  to get the supply, or the application takes months to crack).

  There is a grace-period of 3 days: if a new version came out in the last 3 
  days before your release, you will not get nuked if you release the older 
  one.

- Releases should provide the same functionality as a retail copy of the
  application (where possible and reasonable). Examples:
  - a virus scanner must be able to update
  - a flexlm application should include every useful feature
  - a keygen should provide either all, or the best license (watermarks are 
    still allowed)

- Your nfo should provide a minimum of useful information, including:
  - (complete) application name
  - (complete) version, including if it is a beta version
  - the release date
  - type of crack included
  - short description of the application/game
  - description on how to use the crack (important!)
  - operating systems this release will work on
  - pre-requisites for the application/game
  - url to the application's website

- If you do not want your work to be used by other groups (be it documents, 
  cracking methods, tools, or similar), then make sure you don't give it out
  to anyone you can't trust. It is deemed public property as soon as it is
  publicly available, and you lose any exclusive rights to it.

- Stealing cracks/keygens from P2P, WEB, or other scene groups is clearly not 
  allowed!

- Security should be everyone's primary concern. Including nicknames or
  identities of people that have not given explicit permission in your nfo's 
  is absolutely not allowed, and may result in severe repercussions.

A big thanks to everyone involved in creating this document!

  <p>Adobe became aware on January 2, 2010 of a computer security incident involving a sophisticated, coordinated attack against corporate network systems managed by Adobe and other companies. We are currently in contact with other companies and are investigating the incident. At this time, we have no evidence to indicate that any sensitive information–including customer, financial, employee or any other sensitive data–has been compromised.
