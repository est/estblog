              <h2 class="card-title">ChatGPT释义意大利国歌歌词</h2>
            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>看到 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34027318">HN 上</a> 有人让 ChatGPT 解释笑话。突然想起来之前看过很多外语歌词对其中内涵很不理解。</p>
<p>比如<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Canto_degli_Italiani">意大利国歌</a>有这么一段：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Son giunchi che piegano  他们是弯曲的芦苇  The mercenary swords<br />
le spade vendute:  卖掉的剑。  Are feeble reeds <br />
già l'Aquila d'Austria  已经是奥地利的鹰  Already the Eagle of Austria<br />
le penne ha perdute.  已经失去了它的羽毛。  Hath lost its plumes <br />
Il sangue d'Italia,  意大利的血。  The blood of Italy,<br />
il sangue Polacco,  波兰人的血统。  the Polish blood <br />
bevé, col cosacco,  喝了酒，和哥萨克人一起。  It drank, along with the Cossack, <br />
ma il cor le bruciò.  但心却燃烧了他们。  But it burned its heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>第一句骂雇佣军都是弱鸡我能理解，但是雇佣军跟意大利有什么过节？不懂；</p>
<p>剩下的就比较迷了：骂匈牙利是不是跟意大利有过节？波兰的血是跟意大利是仇人还是同盟？为啥又跟哥萨克扯在一起了？</p>
<p>当然这里面牵扯太多的历史的背景知识了，没能短时间查到内涵的渊源。这种属于本地人可能比较熟悉，外地人压根不会问的问题，所以也不会有人放到网上讨论。顺理成章也搜索不到。我也很难从繁杂的亚平宁半岛历史里快速找到关键。因为欧洲实在小国太多太乱了。。</p>
<p>没想到 ChatGPT 居然解决了这个问题，还是很优秀的那种。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They are reeds that bend<br />
the swords sold:<br />
already the Austrian eagle<br />
has lost its feathers.<br />
The blood of Italy,<br />
the Polish blood,<br />
drank, with the Cossack,<br />
but the heart burned it."</p>
<p>This verse refers to a historical event in which Italy was invaded and occupied by foreign powers, including Austria and Russia. The reeds in the first line are symbols of resilience and resistance, as they are able to bend and sway in the wind without breaking. The swords that are mentioned in the second line may refer to the weapons of the Italian people, who have been forced to sell them to the occupying powers. The third line refers to the symbol of the Austrian Empire, the eagle, which has lost its power and influence.</p>
<p>The fourth line introduces the theme of blood and sacrifice, with the blood of Italy and Poland being mentioned. The fifth line mentions the Cossacks, who were a group of nomadic warriors from the Russian Empire. The sixth line suggests that although the invading forces may have been able to physically conquer and control the Italian people, their spirit and determination could not be broken. The heart, symbolizing the spirit of the Italian people, burned with a desire for freedom and independence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>让 chatgpt 再用中文解释了一遍</p>
<blockquote>
<p>这句话提到了意大利被外国势力占领和占领的历史事件，包括奥地利和俄罗斯。第一行的芦苇是韧性和抵抗的象征，因为它们能够在风中弯曲而不会断开。第二行提到的剑可能指的是意大利人民的武器，他们被迫卖给占领势力。第三行提到了奥地利帝国的象征——鹰，它已经失去了权力和影响力。<br />
第四行引入了血液和牺牲的主题，提到了意大利和波兰的血液。第五行提到了骑兵，他们是俄罗斯帝国的流浪武士。第六行表明，尽管侵略势力可能已经能够物理上征服和控制意大利人民，但他们的精神和决心不能被打压。心脏象征着意大利人民的精神，充满了获得自由和独立的渴望。<br />
总的来说，这句话描述了意大利在历史上遭受的侵略和占领，但是意大利人民坚强不屈，他们的精神从未被打压，并且一直渴望获得自由和独立。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>所以 芦苇 居然不是贬义词，是褒义词。意思是顶着风不折？？？？？？虽然不知道这是不是真的，但是至少这个说法很有趣。。。</p>
<p>歌词里面 波兰的血 也比较迷。是不是波兰入侵了意大利？继续问</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: is Poland an ally or enemy in this verse?</p>
<p>Poland is not described as either an ally or an enemy. The verse mentions the blood of Italy and the blood of Poland together, suggesting that both countries have suffered and sacrificed in some way. It is not clear from the context of the verse how the two countries were related or whether they were allied or in conflict with each other at the time.<br />
It is important to note that the verse is part of the Italian national anthem and was written in the mid-19th century, a time when Italy was facing foreign occupation and struggles for independence. The mention of Poland in the verse may simply be a metaphor for the shared experiences of suffering and sacrifice that both countries have endured.<br />
Q: 歌词里 波兰的血 是什么意思<br />
在你提供的这句话中，"波兰的血" 可能是指波兰人民所遭受的痛苦和牺牲。血液通常被用作一种比喻，来表示人们所承受的苦难和牺牲。在这首歌中，意大利和波兰的血液被提到了一起，可能是在暗示这两个国家都经历了某种痛苦和牺牲。<br />
但是，从这句话的上下文中并不清楚这两个国家在那个时候是如何相关的，或者他们是否是盟友或是对立的。<br />
重要的是要注意，这句话是意大利国歌的一部分，是在19世纪中期写的，那时意大利正面临外国占领和争取独立的斗争。在这首歌中提到波兰可能只是一种比喻，表示意大利和波兰都经历了共同的苦难和牺牲。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>虽然 ChatGPT 很多解释是乱来的，但是这至少提供了一种看上去比较合理的说法，比我瞎猜的靠谱多了。。</p></p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>厂里终于开始用笨拙的Jira了。总体用下来跟 Teambition 相比各有各的笨处。。。</p>
<p>默认的 board 过滤器有点不好用。本着为了stand-up meeting和周报快速检索上一个工作日和当周干了什么，找到一个 filter 写法：</p>
<h3>JQL过滤上一个工作日干了啥：</h3>
<pre><code>(updatedDate &lt; endofweek("-8d") AND updatedDate &gt; startofday("-3d")) OR updatedDate &gt; startofday("-1d")
</code></pre>
<p>这里不是简单的查昨天干了啥。比如周一需要看周五干了啥。所以有个 <code>-8d</code> 并 <code>-3d</code> 的神奇操作。具体的逻辑自己琢磨</p>
<h3>过滤本周干了啥</h3>
<pre><code>updatedDate &gt;= startOfWeek(0)
</code></pre>
<p>Jira这种资本主义软件是没法适配我们社会主义法定节假日的设定。所以遇到非双休放假还是判断起来比较蛋痛。</p>
<p>其实我比较反感每天早上开站会。我比较推荐每天下班前最后10分钟开会。好处有：</p>
<ol>
<li>当天干了什么记得很清楚。明天需要干什么也很显然。</li>
<li>如果谁拖堂，谁就承担对不起大家不能准时下班的道德压力</li>
<li>如果都开会了你事情都还没做完，要么你事情安排得太多，要么你完成能力不足，要么你时间安排有问题。</li>
</ol>
<p>之前在两个公司这样执行过。结果被大老板强行改到早上开会了。无语。</p></p>

            <p class="card-text"><blockquote>
<p>Q: can we play the 20q game?<br />
A: Sure, we can play the 20 Questions game! I'll think of an object, and you can try to guess what it is by asking up to 20 yes or no questions. Are you ready to begin?</p>
<p>Q: yes. Is it a man?<br />
A: No, I'm sorry, but the object I am thinking of is not a man. You can ask another question to try to narrow down what the object might be.</p>
<p>Q: is it an object that can be hold with human hands?<br />
A: Yes, the object I am thinking of can be held in the hand. This should give you a better idea of what the object might be, but you still have several questions left to ask if you need them. Can you think of another question to help narrow down the possibilities?</p>
<p>Q: is it an everyday object that has vibrant colors?<br />
A: No, I'm sorry, but the object I am thinking of is not an everyday object with vibrant colors. It may be something more common or everyday, or it may be a different color altogether. You can continue to ask questions if you would like to try to guess what the object is, or you can make a guess now if you think you know.</p>
<p>Q: Is it consumable by humans?<br />
A: No, the object I am thinking of is not something that can be consumed by humans. It is a physical object that can be held and manipulated, but it is not something that can be eaten or drunk. You can continue to ask questions if you would like to try to guess what the object is, or you can make a guess now if you think you know.</p>
<p>Q: Is it a toy for kids?<br />
A: No, I'm sorry, but the object I am thinking of is not a toy for kids. It may be something that is used by kids, or it may be something that is associated with kids in some way, but it is not a toy. You can continue to ask questions if you would like to try to guess what the object is, or you can make a guess now if you think you know.</p>
<p>Q: Is it made of metal or partly made of metal?<br />
A: Yes, the object I am thinking of is made of metal, or at least partly made of metal. This should give you a better idea of what the object might be, but you still have several questions left to ask if you need them. Can you think of another question to help narrow down the possibilities?</p>
<p>Q: is it something you can drive with<br />
A: Yes, the object I am thinking of is something that can be driven. This should give you a better idea of what the object might be, but you still have several questions left to ask if you need them. Can you think of another question to help narrow down the possibilities?</p>
<p>Q: is it a car?<br />
A: Yes, that's correct! The object I was thinking of is a car. Congratulations on guessing the correct answer with only a few questions! Cars are a common form of transportation that are made of metal and can be driven by people. I'm glad you were able to guess the correct answer. Do you want to play again and see if you can guess another object?</p>

              <h2 class="card-title">Web Animation实现页面逐渐变灰</h2>
            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>在2006年我开始网上留下印记的时候，写了一个 dHTML 特效模拟<a href="https://blog.est.im/cnblogs/600413">XP关机对话框变灰</a>， 那个时候大行其道的还是IE6，用的还是微软特有的 <code>filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Fade</code> 叠加两个<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>实现。</p>
<p>今天（2022-11-30）恰好长者去逝，学习一下最新的css姿势再实现一次。本来想用 CSS Animation+Filter实现，还是比较麻烦。比如我参考的例子是<a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/recreating-the-red-dead-redemption-2-tintype-loading-screen-effect-in-css-10ca87d5b9de">模仿 Red Dead Redemption 2</a> 照片效果css</p>
<pre><code>  #invert{
    filter: invert(1.0) grayscale(1.0);
  }
  #photo{
    animation: blur 5s infinite alternate;
  }
  @keyframes blur{
    from{
      filter: blur(3px);
      opacity: 0;
    }
    to{
      filter: blur(0px);
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>这个方式有个问题就是需要单独设置一个 <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> 元素。后来经过 <a href="https://twitter.com/yuanchuan23">@yuanchuan23</a> 的指点发现可以通过 Web Animation 更简单的实现：</p>
<pre><code>  document.body.animate([
    {filter: 'brightness(none) grayscale(0%)'},
    {filter: 'brightness(10) grayscale(10%)', offset: 0.2},
    {filter: 'brightness(1) grayscale(100%)'}
  ], {duration: 2000, fill: 'forwards'})
</code></pre>
<p>这样写比 css 方便多了。加一个类似照相机闪光灯过曝的效果。其中 <code>fill: 'forwards'</code> 可以让变灰之后停下来。</p>
<p>放一个 demo 在这里：<a href="https://lab.est.im/grayscale_animation">https://lab.est.im/grayscale_animation</a> 点一下可以再变一次</p></p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>发现一个有点好玩的东东 <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto">ATP(Authenticated Transfer Protocol)协议</a>，是 ActivityPub 的竞品。ATP对应 blusky，AP 对应 Mastodon</p>
<p>其中<a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/issues/255#issuecomment-1287953987">维护者pfraze谈到为什么</a>要抛开 ActivityPub 单独搞一套协议：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of differing design decisions.</p>
<p>Account portability is a major reason why we chose to build a separate protocol. Signed data repositories and DIDs are both unique to ATP and not terribly easy to retrofit into ActivityPub.</p>
<p>There are smaller things as well: a different viewpoint about how schemas should be handled, a preference for domain usernames over AP’s double-@ email usernames, and the goal of having large scale search and discovery (rather than the hashtag style of discovery that AP favors).</p>
<p>Meta:</p>
<p>The AP community has always been somewhat suspicious of Bluesky, for reasons that are understandable. AP’s community is volunteer driven and the users joined to escape Twitter. So, here we come, a startup funded by Twitter, with strong opinions on how the tech should be done. I’ve heard concerns that we’d “embrace, extend, &amp; extinguish.” I’ve heard concerns that we’d force through changes that people don’t want by dint of being a funded company. You can criticize us for going a different direction but I think it’d have been a difficult collaboration if we chose to use AP, especially since we weren’t willing to compromise on some of the decisions above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>其中ATP 支持直接用域名而不是 Mastodon 的双at <code>@someone@somesite.com</code> 的形式，我觉得非常好！</p>

<li>2022-11-08 糖尿病是因为气候变化导致的，历史上曾经有在1000年内全球气温降了30度。进化导致血液中糖含量变高以抵御寒冷天气。这些人生存下来，但现在成了病。</li>
<li>2022-11-08 囊性纤维化会是种致命的遗传病，但是当年对抗<a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Vd4y1b7gX">结核病</a>遗传下来的。病被消灭了，遗传就成了病。</li>
<li>2022-11-08 进化是为了保证你活到繁殖期。过了繁殖年龄之后，就自求多福了。</li>
</ul>
<p>从这个角度出发，可以得到一个简单粗暴的二极管结论：</p>
<p>从自然的角度来说，人生的快乐和欢愉都指向同一个终点——繁殖；繁殖之后剩下的生命，所有的苦恼纯粹是自找的。</p>
<p>这个道理对于动物来说估计都成立吧。但是我感觉人类又不一样：人类额外发明了语言和文化，又是群居社会动物。无论是猿人部落还是现代院子家庭，直亲还经常出于愿意和被迫把扶养后代的活儿外包给祖父母辈。人类幼崽超长幼年期麻烦还是不少的。</p>
<p>想起来有个说法，说古代人平均寿命也就30左右，现代人能活到70+的寿命其实历史不长。超长的寿命带来的问题是古人解决不了的，因为古人普遍活不了那么长。古人送命的机会太多了，难产，饥饿，野兽，战争。</p>
<p>又想起来为啥春秋多义士，我猜是那个年代稍微人丁兴旺的农耕家族，个人的存在意义是很渺小的，除了家族能提供的有限支持，普遍没有社会保障，普通庶出的人，在碌碌无为中意外死亡的情况太多了。所以能成就一点「义」其实很划得来。相比「秦」制之下，每个人的发展被固定到了国家机器的轨道上，整个人生就被二向化：要么立军功，要么被隔壁老王立军功来束缚你。这个制度刚性到什么程度，连战神白起晚年被贬为普通士卒发配到甘肃，居然不用担心他任何反叛的可能性。后世那种什么节度使拥军自重的 bug 压根不存在。</p>
<p>扯远了。之前也想过<a href="/201910/stdout-006">生命的意义</a>这些问题，但是没想过的是这个意义完成之后会发生什么？现代人普遍活到 70+ 的寿命，其实不是一个历史常见的现象。这是工业革命带来的农药化肥+青霉素作为保障，商业社会带来海量的以和平为主的个体发展机遇，</p>
<p>比如</p>
<blockquote>
<p>某加拿大极端保守播主：女人能活到80岁，但40岁就不能生孩子了！如果没有小孩，她怎么过剩下来的40年？<br />
《雷神》导演回复：环游世界、感受生活的美好、创造艺术、帮扶自己的亲属、遇到自己爱的人、找寻属于自己的快乐、成就事业、获得别人的认可，然后在你这个满怀仇恨渡过渺小一生的人的坟头蹦迪。</p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><blockquote>
<p>在二十世纪上半叶，苏联柑橘专家(Citrology在当时是一个重要学科)在-30℃的低温下在<strong>户外</strong>种植（亚）热带植物，而且不使用玻璃或任何燃料辅助。<br />
During the first half of the twentieth century, Soviet citrologists grew (sub)tropical plants in temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius – outdoors, and without the use of glass or any fossil fuel-powered assistance.<br />
"渐进式抗冻" “Progressive cold-hardening”<br />
进口的柑橘品种只在黑海沿岸几个孤立的地方存活，那里的小气候特别有利。为了使柑橘类水果更好地适应寒冷，苏联的柑橘学家采用了一种叫做 "渐进式抗冻"的方法。这使他们能够创造出适应当地生态条件的新品种，这种栽培策略最初是为杏树和葡萄开发的。<br />
Imported citrus varieties only survived in a few isolated points along the Black Sea coast, which enjoyed a particularly favourable microclimate. To better prepare citrus fruits for cold, Soviet citrologists followed a method called “progressive cold-hardening”. It allowed them to create new varieties which were adapted to local ecological conditions, a cultivation strategy which had originally been developed for apricot trees and grapes.<br />
该方法包括将珍贵的树木种子种植在其原始位置的更北边，然后等待它结出种子。然后将这些种子再向北种植，并反复重复这一过程，缓慢但稳定地将柑橘品种推向不太适宜的气候。利用这种方法，Rostov-on-Don(北纬47°N的一座城市，挨着亚速海)的杏树最终可以在北方650公里以外的Michurinsk(北纬52°N)种植，他们在那里开发了适应当地气候的杏树种子。另一方面，直接将Rostov 杏树的种子种植在Michurinsk证明是不成功的。<br />
The method consists of planting a seed of a highly valued tree a bit further north of its original location, and then waiting for it to give seeds. Those seeds are then planted a bit further north, and with the process repeated further, slowly but steadily pushing the citrus variety towards less hospitable climates. Using this method, apricot trees from Rostov could eventually be grown in Mitchurinsk, 650 km further up north, where they developed apricot seeds that were adapted to the local climate. On the other hand, directly planting the seed of the Rostov apricot tree in Mitchurinsk proved unsuccessful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>不要再吹儒家智慧了。无产阶级才是真的智慧。。。</p>
<p>~~这故事唯一的毛病就是 Rostov 和 Michurinsk 这城市的位置似乎弄反了？反正纬度没太对劲。。。~~</p>
<p>更新：原来是 Rostov-on-Don，不是 Rostov(北纬57°N的一座城市，莫斯科以北202km涅罗湖岸边)</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33647875">via</a></p>
<p>另外「橘生淮南为橘，生淮北为枳」这句话本身也是错的</p>
<blockquote>
<p>橘和枳原本就是两个根本不同的物种，在生物学特征中，橘与枳同属芸香科，虽枝、叶、果实形态相似，但枳比橘耐寒，可逾淮河而生。而橘喜温，逾淮河过了1月0℃等温线就会被冬天的霜雪冻死。所以，不是橘到淮北变成了枳，而是淮北只有枳而无橘。</p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>今天在看到<a href="https://www.solidot.org/story?sid=73284">有人发</a>了个《男性觉醒知识库》觉得太荒唐了。然后就看到<a href="https://v2ex.com/t/893244">评论区</a>有人贴了个《教姐妹们如何要彩礼》更无语。。出处未知，作者未知。请选择性食用。本文使用 DeepL 翻译，有小修订。</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: This is a DeepL translated feminist piece with minor modifications, the origin &amp; authenticity is unknown, I stand neutral to this article</em></p>
<h2>Bride price Guide for Fellow Sisters 教姐妹们如何要彩礼</h2>
<p>The proletarian mentor Friedrich Engels said in <em>Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pairing family, also known as monogamous marriage, originates from private ownership. It is characterized by the male subjugation of the female in gender relations, the disappearance of the female from public life and her forced return to the family, as well as by the denial of sexual freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feminist theory holds that "marriage is essentially a form of male exploitation of women, an oppression of the powerful by the vulnerable." Combined with our extensive practice in real life, it is easy to see that many women are deprived of their birth rights, education rights, employment rights, etc. for various reasons. But those with vested interests are never satisfied and are further infringing on the rights of their sisters. Since there is too much content, I will not expand here, but only briefly discuss how sisters can protect their rights in marriage.</p>
<p>When sisters get married, they always encounter confusion: How do you want the bride price? How can I make my husband's family pay attention to it and not be a sufferer in the past? How to buy gold jewelry? How to get added to the ownership of the house, etc. all kinds of problems plagued the sisters to be married, today the author through this article one-stop solution to the sisters on the wedding trouble.</p>
<p>Glossory:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bride price</code> 彩礼</li>
<li><code>mama's boy</code> 妈宝男</li>
<li><code>ugly duckling</code> 凤凰男</li>
</ul>
<h3>I. Choosing a partner</h3>
<p>Marriage is a big deal, is the second birth of our women, so how to choose a reliable marriage object is the key to the key.</p>
<p>On the marriage, especially marriage to remote places, I have heard a very apt phrase: "If the male makes you mad at noon, and your father's can't slap him in the face overnight, then you have married too far." Sisters can tend to this principle when choosing a marriage partner.</p>
<p>The following details about how to choose a marriage partner.</p>
<h4>(A) the classification of men</h4>
<p>Contemporary Chinese men are generally of worst quality. Lazy, shy, greasy, obscene, no taste of life, no aesthetics, no formality, and even w many are <strong>Mama's Boy</strong>. Therefore, sisters must be extra cautious when looking for a marriage partner, you may want to date several at the same time, the best of the best, after all, in nature only the strongest males are qualified to mate and reproduce. The most important thing is to find a quality genetic provider for your children, even for the sake of the next generation. In this case, I will divide men into three categories: Quality Male, Ugly Duckling and Ordinary Men.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Quality Male: refers to the height of 180cm-185cm, business parents or working in the government plus physically healthy and with a good pension; at least two loan-free property registered in Tier-I cities (Beijing, Shanghai, GuangZhou, Shenzhen), liquidity of no less than 3 million RMB, annual income not less than 50,000 RMB, a master's degree or above men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ugly Duckling: a man who meets any four of the requirements for a "Quality Male".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ordinary Men: a man who meets any two of the requirements of a "Quality Male".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creatures: Not recommended. Don't bother to contact anyone below the standard of the Ordinary Men</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>(B) Mate Selection Strategy</h4>
<p>THe Quality Male are one-in-a-million chance. Grab it while you can and never let go. If you are losing it, get pregnant and make him a daddy. The sooner you gets this the better, the winner takes all.</p>
<p>For Ugly Ducklings, dating two or more at the same time, choice the best. Prioritize a handsome tall one, after all, the good looking bores your less in future days.</p>
<p>For Ordinary Men, you can consider use a "spare tire", "male BFF" strategy, just in case you meet a Ugly Duckling or a Quality Male is a jerk, then at least a guaranteed option, this type of man is best limited at 3-5, too many too busy. Give them an above-friendship but not-yet-lovers state, do not let them easily get you.</p>
<p>Pay special attention: Be wary of Mama's Boy! Be wary of Mama's Boy! Be wary of Mama's Boy!. Because Mama's Boy's money = his mom's money ≠ your money, if you meet Mama's Boy, even if he is Quality Male, don't engage. In order to identify Mama's Boy, trust your sixth sense, when you assume a man is a Mama's Boy, then he must be.</p>
<h3>II. Marriage Preparation</h3>
<h4>(A) Tame men</h4>
<p>Warning: the following strategies do not apply to Quality Male, Quality Male are OK as long as they are not Mama's Boy, not alcoholic, no gambling, no domestic violence, no prostitution, everything else is acceptable.</p>
<p>Please sisters remember the phrase: "Never marry a man who do not kneel down to wash the feet". In the dating stage, no matter what our own character is, we have to make a cool and poker face. This will give the man to form a psychological expectation that he needs to pay desperately more to cater to your approval. But you can not be too cool, give back little sweetness to warm his confidence, make him feel that you are unreachable, to maintain a status of near-approchable.</p>
<p>Tactic one: for example, he invited you to dinner, buy him a milk tea in return; he invited you to an amusement park or bar, you can send him a keychain, plush toys and other small gifts.</p>
<p>Second tactic: deliberately throw some tantrum but not too excessive, make him argue, and then you pretend to be angry, blacklist his contact, wait for him to apologize &amp; ask forgiveness</p>
<p>Third tactic: occasionally care about his parents, let him think you tender and considerate, and then take him to see your parents (he can not go empty-handed), giving him a feeling that you have taken him as family.</p>
<p>In conclusion: men are a very naive creature, they are easily touched by your small guestures, to imaging you are the true love. So you have to learn to play small to game big, giving a little to increase the man to your niceness. Taming men should be like taming dogs, to be rigid and soft, only then they can be controlled to the direction you want. But remember not to over doing it, that will swing men away, unless you really wanted to, or want to force him to do something silly. Don't believe the honesty, too much pressure will only make the crack. Of course, you can not be too soft, then you will lose.</p>
<h4>(B) Manipulate the man</h4>
<p>After you have tamed the man, basically the man has been obedient to you. This is the time you have to decisively seize his salary card, bank card, the reason is afraid that he would waste money, you have to plan for the future life. This time the man will feel that you are right, and will think that you are really thinking about your future.</p>
<p>After the economy grab, you'd gave him some weekly allowances. Give more if you are happy, less if not. But do not spent all the money as this belongs to the premarital property, you are at most considered the keeper. Refrain to spend after marriage.</p>
<p>You can take the money to invest at funds or something, he will be too shy to ask for the profits, instead he will praise your housekeeping skills.</p>
<p>Tighten the economic control gradually, and crack down his private savings. For example, if for three months in a row you give him 1000 yuan pocket money he does not complain, he even gifts you sometimes, then it is recommended to drop to 800 yuan in the begining of the fourth month. Maintain a level just enough for his spendings. After all, the more he spends, the less you get.</p>
<p>If he questions this behavior, you will show him the financial gains to shut him up, if necessary, you can send friends or friends in common to pressure him, of course, do not forget to let your BFF to play: "My boyfriend only need 500 yuan a month pocket money, you got 800 that's really quite a lot."</p>
<p>After mastering the man's economic lifeline, you have to occasionally spend your money, note that it is your money not his, buy his parents some gifts. This generation of men's parents are very easy to handle, they are still very simple-minded, or the kind of "male dominant business female dominant family" or "a good daughter-in-law to prosper three generations" of mental. Give them an image of you as a "good daughter-in-law" and let them put pressure the man so you can get married soon.</p>
<h3>III. Marriage Negotiations</h3>
<p>Once you start preparing for marriage, then you will inevitably avoid talking about the bride price, dowry and other issues. Because of your previous operation to please his parents, at this time, just ask for the bride price. The groom's parents will be generous, they are in a hurry for the wedding.</p>
<p>First of all, the gold, in some places "five golds" are needed to get married, some places for "three golds", but no matter what, the advice is don't over do it. Because this thing is not worn every day, and will lose value if sold, it is too much of a loss, a better alternativeis focusing on bride price and property.</p>
<p>The amount of bride price varies, in principle, not less than 200,000 RMB. Real-estate co-ownership is naturally required, we will skip the details, but here we talk about the dialog tactics whenever applicable:</p>
<h4>1. The Attitude Card</h4>
<p>The fact is the amount of bride price doesn't matter, it's an attitude issue, it shows the importance out of the groom's mind. In case of bargining from the groom, bring out your BFF, pretend that she asked for X amount of bride price, gave birth to two sons to the groom's family, and is now living happily. Just make it up because they won't look it up.</p>
<p>Note: If your groom is taking it serisoly, say that if you want the attitude, you'd rather donate the money to charity in your name, so that you can prove the itention,  it would be meaningful. If he still doesn't want to give the bride price, staying away from such a stingy brain bad man is recommended</p>
<h4>2. The Tradition Card</h4>
<p>You insist on claiming that the bride price is just a custom in your hometown, your whole family is very traditional, so if you don't want it, your parents will lose face. And where you from the price is not negotiable. This method can be used in combination with the "attitude card" for better yields. Finally, it boils down to the question: "Do you really love me?" The "Are you trying to fake a marriage on me?" is a soul-crushing question.</p>
<p>Note: If you are "open" in your private life, have richer dating experiences, with more sex experience, not that conservative, then don't use this method. For example, you often state something like "Does it matter to be a virgin? How is it a woman's duty to give birth to a child and take care of the household? The Qing Dynasty is long gone!" and such. Then give him the "tradition matters, it's always this way", then possibly the groom will clear his head take the high ground.</p>
<h4>3. Compensation card</h4>
<p>You insist that giving birth is for the man, the bride price is the compensation for the woman's suffering in childbirth, after all, pregnancy will seriously affect your career, you had the opportunity to become a multi-millionaire or even billionaire. Because of the child, a mother will have to settle for a monthly salary of 3,000 RMB. At the same time, your body is greatly affected by the birth of a child, there are postpartum conditions, so you must ask for compensation.</p>
<p>Note: To examine the IQ of a man, use this method selectively. Some men will be thankful for your dedication after hearing you say that having a child is not easy. Some other will have huge empathy for his mom and convert to Mama's Boy and be grateful and obedient to his mom. The worst case he will think: since you say the baby is for me, then we do not even need a marriage, you give me the baby, I give you the money and we are clear? Or he will discuss the price of surrogacy with you and think that we should replace the mother and keep the child. Sisters, believe me, such a man must not be married. If you marry, your day of divorce is counted.</p>
<p>Remember, if you divorce a man, you must claim custody of the child, because it is your child, and with the child you can ask him for alimony and succession rights!</p>
<h4>4. Value card</h4>
<p>This type of method is applicable to sisters who are outstanding in appearance and assets. "I'm so good, I'm not worth this much bride price?" "Do I really care that you have this little money?" You should express your disdain for this bride price with an attitude of deep apathy, as well as the posture of "marry me of fuck off". But do not forget, after the marriage your money is yours, his money are also yours, soft hearted to men means hard hearted to oneself. Li Xueqin also said: "Women should pity themselves, pity men brings bad luck for life." So never let easy on the male.</p>
<p>Note: If the other side is more blunt , such method is likely to fail.</p>
<h4>5. The Binding card</h4>
<p>This method is suitable for sisters who have been dating men for a long time. "I have been with you for so long, my youth is not worth this money?" "Do you love me or do you love money?" "You really love me or this money is all you can provide?" Bind the bride price to your time, youth, &amp; heart, force the groom to obey. Men are very reflective creatures, they will always introspect their own problem, like am I a miser?, so when you use this method along with cold violence, such as crying while staring at him, do not speak, call his parents to tell them you might never be able to call them parents-in-law again, or directly tell him the wedding is canceled. Don't be afraid to use your feelings to blackmail him, because he can't find anyone better than you and your previous good moments together. The people around him would usually persuade over and over, and most likely his parents will start scolding him.</p>
<p>Note: Pay attention to cultivate his ability to introspect at soon as possible, do not let him to punder "my own youth is not worthy?" "Do I gave less than you?". This method is suitable for men who have been tamed for a long time.</p>
<h4>6. The "Assurance" method</h4>
<p>When the groom thinks the bride price is too high, you have to reason with him: "I don't need the bride price either, but I want some assurance", "I can't take care of my parents if I marry you, so I have to leave some money for my parents." "I'm very insecure, I'm afraid of being hurt in marriage, I just want a guarantee." "My family raised me for so many years, paid for my education, so what's wrong with asking for a dowry?" No matter what happens later, get the bride price first. After that, you can then talk about gender equality, even the one child must have to bear the responsibility of parental care. Men always admit this in general.</p>
<p>Note: If you have a well-off family background, this method would be a bit funny, it is recommended sisters married far away or sub-par family conditions use it wisely.</p>
<h4>7. The Double Act</h4>
<p>Double act method basically means good cop bad cop. Don't ask for anything, just prepare for marriage, Let your parents be the bad cop, ask the terms, use the first 6 methods, negotiate with the groom. When pressure amounts you just be the good cop to pull back a little. This is the best strategy, avoid direct conflict between you and the groom's family, on the other hand, can also make the man take your favor, you can speak up.</p>
<p>The most important thing to note: some men will think twice, they think that marriage is a matter of two families, you are just pretending to be innocent. So it's a good idea to always keep the image of a baby girl, with no calculating behind, the "baby doll" type of sister.</p>
<p>Please combine the tactics above when negotiating about the bride price for better  effects. Some people may feel that the above methods are schemes, then I have to tell you, as the famous criminal psychology expert Professor Li Meijin once said: "The biggest payoff for women is pregnancy, and their womb is another kind of property. And then there is breastfeeding, the most precious food product from a mother. So in return, men must provide household, financial support to raise the family, this is the natural way, break this contract, there will be consequences......".</p>
<h3>III. The wedding</h3>
<p>There is nothing special about the wedding, just arrange it in your way, the man pays the bill. Remember that during the wedding day you must not test the man too much, or he will be too embarrassed. Although he paid the bride price, but his heart will be somewhat uncomfortable. Men are all about face, so they trade money for face, you just use swap his face for money.</p>
<p>Let him arrange the red envelope in advance, all in proper place, reception of bride's family should be slightly challenged, do not screw up the rest of wedding.</p>
<h3>IV. The married life and divorce</h3>
<p>As already said in the previous article, marriage is the second birth of women, we may not be born into a good family at the beginning, but can live a good life through a good marriage. A friend of the author once said to me that marriage itself is a transaction. We women can compromise certain false things in marriage, such as the last name, family, paternal rights and so on for exchanging true values. This matter weights less if you think about it less, so I suggest that the sisters do not care the surname, it's you gaving birth to your children, how can it not be yours? But these stuff can be used as a bargaining chip, do not let the husband get too easily.</p>
<p>According to China's judicial practice, generally speaking, divorce a year after marriage, the bride price is awarded 100% to the woman as joint property after the marriage or as a gift arising from the marriage. The dowry is characterized as the woman's pre-marital property. Therefore, even if you are not satisfied with your husband, you'd better stay on for more than one year.</p>
<p>According to our judicial practice, even if a woman cheats in marriage and has a child that is not her husband's own, the child is still to be raised by the man as a legitimate child.</p>
<p>Again according to our judicial practice, even if the man bought the house before marriage, under his full payment, but once added your co-ownership, then you are able to divide a certain percentage.</p>
<p>Still according to China's judicial practice, in certain areas, "cheating while married, the agreed property goes to the party with no fault" prenuptial agreement is recognized by the court.</p>
<p>So I suggest that sisters on a date must study the marriage law, consult a lawyer, sign a good prenuptial agreement. Whether the other party will cheat, best to believe that men are unable to withstand temptation. Without going into too much detail, there are many tactics, in order to the harmony of the family I can only stop here.</p>
<p>When divorce must pay attention to emphasize that the husband practice domestic violence, alcoholic, gambling and other vices. In daily life to pay attention to keep the evidence, make small problems big, and then force him to apologize, let him sign a desist letter. Don't underestimate these warranties, they are recognized by the court in case of a divorce.</p>
<p>In the case of domestic violence, it is important to remember that even if you havn't been abused, you should always take pictures of your casual injuries for other reasons as evidence of domestic violence. It is the other party's business to clarify and the lawyer's business to argue, so you are responsible for providing all kinds of evidence there can be.</p>
<p>The most important point is that you should try to find a female judge for your divorce case! Because only women judges will help women, only girls will help girls!</p>
<h3>V. Conclusion</h3>
<p>To believe in the state, believe in the law. The state can't wait for every man to get married, because men without a family is on the loose and destablize the society. Sisters must have confidence, don't be afraid of trouble, whether it is microblogging, socialnetworks, the court or the husband's work place, as long as you dare to fight, in most cases the other party will compromise.</p>
<p>Sisters, you must believe in your own power, protect yourself, and be an independent woman and excel. Cheers</p></p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>玩 WebRTC 的时候发现它居然内置<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/11/webrtc-sending-dtmf-in-firefox/">支持了 DTMF 拨号音</a>。</p>
<p>这里就简单科普一下，DTMF 就是手机电话拨号音，数字按键按下去嘟嘟嘟响那个。具体就2个频率调谐：</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>DTMF</th>
<th>1209Hz</th>
<th>1336Hz</th>
<th>1477Hz</th>
<th>1633Hz</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>697Hz</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>770Hz</td>
<td>4</td>
<td>5</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>852Hz</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>941Hz</td>
<td>*</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>#</td>
<td>D</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>于是兴趣来了想做一个 demo 玩玩，写了半天调试不通，报错</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VM987:1 Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'insertDTMF' on 'RTCDTMFSender': The 'canInsertDTMF' attribute is false: this sender cannot send DTMF.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>仔细研究了下<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Using_DTMF">这玩意</a>，原来 WebRTC 不直接传音频，而是发一个控制信号，由接收方播放出音频，所以你需要本地创建一个真实的双工 RTC 并打开麦克风权限，才能播放DTMF音频。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebRTC doesn't send DTMF codes as audio data. Instead, they're sent out-of-band, as RTP payloads. Note, however, that although it's possible to send DTMF using WebRTC, there is currently no way to detect or receive incoming DTMF. WebRTC currently ignores these payloads;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>这样就走远了。于是又手痒用 <code>AudioContext()</code> 糊了一个。一共不到1000字节。</p>
<p><a href="https://lab.est.im/dtmf">https://lab.est.im/dtmf</a> <a href="https://github.com/est/snippets/blob/master/dtmf/index.html">源码</a></p>
<p>嗯。就挺简单的。特别是那个 oscillator有个 <code>.stop(0.2)</code> 参数可以避免 <code>setTimeout</code> 的麻烦。网上很多教程整复杂了。</p>
<p>btw 把一些老脚本挂在 lab 域名下。<br />
btw2 把 RSS 改成全文输出了。</p></p>

<p>我也看得个半懂，但是文章写得太tm 好了。强烈推荐阅读。因为最近 Nature 有人搞了个大新闻，说他们跑了个机器学习模型分析最近50年的粒子对撞机数据，发现质子里「有的时候」包含一个比质子重的 charm quark。</p>
<p>还学到一个奇妙的比喻，教科书的说法是，质子由 2x <code>up quark</code> 和 1x <code>down quark</code> 构成。这是个巨大的骗术。真实的情况是，质子就是个垃圾堆，里面有成千上万亿的稀奇破玩意。大概可以分成3类，一大堆 antiquark，一大堆 quark 和 一大堆 胶水。只是恰好  <code>up quark</code> 比 <code>up antiquark</code> 多 <code>2</code> 个，<code>down quark</code> 比 <code>down antiquark</code>  多 <code>1</code> 个，外加一大堆胶水(<code>gluon</code>) 和  <code>quark-antiquark pair</code> ，挤在一个 非常小的区域内，以接近光速的速度飞来飞去。</p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>半夜看到个东西，翻来覆去睡不着，就记录一下。</p>
<p>很多人知道老毛的「第三世界」理论，这也是为数不多的由中国人完全贡献通行欧美的顶流政治概念。但是很少有人知道20世纪顶级哲学家 波普 Karl Popper 有另外一套「三个世界」理论。这三个世界分别是：</p>
<ol>
<li>真实的物质世界</li>
<li>人的个性 (character)</li>
<li>人的思想 (idea) </li>
</ol>
<p>卧槽，深邃。作为假装不惑好多年的人，仍然能在生命的这个阶段学习到新的姿势，感觉非常过瘾，让人回味初一自己琢磨哲学的愉快时光。</p>
<p>人的思想又称理性，是通过推理和因果构成的神性世界；人的个性是由情绪、脾气和兽性驱动的喜怒哀乐感性世界。很多人会把这两者混淆成一回事，但是从根本上来说是错误的。人的个性我理解大多是先天遗传(nature)决定的，人的理性是人作为 homo sapien 的独门绝技，是把镜像神经元发挥到极致的后天(nurture)集大成机制。</p>
<p>说起这个我又想起来，以前觉得儒家的王阳明「知行合一」很厉害，直到我看到「自觉、觉他、觉行」这个说法：</p>
<ol>
<li>首先要了解自己，独善其身</li>
<li>其次要以己度人(pun intended)，考虑对方感受和社会整体，毕竟人类是群居动物，由社会定义的存在</li>
<li>最后要把思考成果应用到行动上，否则都是瞎jb空谈，其实这玩意也讲究方法论</li>
</ol>
<p>儒家作为一个上古玩交际起家的教派，没把「他觉」单独拎出来强调，从这个层面上来说落了下风啊。</p>
<p>其实我想说的是，波普恐怕还漏了第四个世界，这个世界是基于 idea 上的虚拟机，这个虚拟机可以去模拟和推演他人的行为、个性和思维的世界，这也是中国人最擅长的，算计他人。</p></p>

            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>帮朋友看一家公司，专门做爬虫的。找到一些有意思的信息，各位可以先猜猜这个题：</p>
<p>2020年以来，大陆各类刑事犯罪中起诉人数排名前3的罪名是？</p>
<ul>
<li>(A) 网上乱发言</li>
<li>(B) 偷东西</li>
<li>(C) 诈骗</li>
<li>(D) 开车出事</li>
<li>(E) 打架、杀人、伤人</li>
<li>(F) 帮别人修理电脑或者网络</li>
<li>(G) 贿赂</li>
</ul>
<details>
  <summary>正确答案：</summary>
  (D) (B) (G) 帮助信息网络犯罪活动罪（以下简称帮信罪）是2015年11月起施行的刑法修正案（九）新增罪名，主要指行为人明知他人利用信息网络实施犯罪，为其犯罪提供互联网接入、服务器托管、网络存储、通信传输等技术支持，或者提供广告推广、支付结算等帮助的犯罪行为，是电信网络犯罪的重要“帮凶”。2019年11月，最高检联合最高法制定出台《关于办理非法利用信息网络、帮助信息网络犯罪活动等刑事案件适用法律若干问题的解释》，明确了帮信罪定罪量刑标准和有关司法认定问题。近年来，特别是2020年10月“断卡”行动以来，检察机关起诉涉嫌帮信犯罪案件上涨较快，目前已成为各类刑事犯罪中起诉人数排名第3的罪名（前两位分别是危险驾驶罪、盗窃罪）。
</details>

<p>然后说回爬虫，最近看到<a href="https://www.spp.gov.cn/spp/llyj/202202/t20220215_544538.shtml">《明确越界网络爬虫行为的刑事处罚边界》</a>，虽然不是法规文件，但是可以参考。总体来说：</p>
<ol>
<li>如果你是 IT  从业人员，那么明知故犯罪加一等</li>
<li>小爬没事，把别人服务器爬出500错误了就麻烦了。需要登录或者有反爬最好不要去碰</li>
<li>公开数据理论上没事。不遵守 <code>robots.txt</code> 也无所谓</li>

<p>以前英国贵族喝茶是要加糖的，因为普通人压根接触不到制成品糖块，加糖是有成本的装逼表现；后来北美甘蔗种植园和远洋贸易导致平民和工人也开始喝茶加糖了，于是贵珠又流行喝清茶了。。。。</p>

<p>电子阳痿怎么说呢，从某些程度来说，选择电子娱乐在当年是一种世外桃源的感觉。以前的娱乐无非是 ktv ，武侠小说，吃喝嫖赌这些。能玩电子游戏，首先家里得有个 386/486/586，那个年代能花几万搞一个电脑还是得很有魄力的。最不济也得是个书香门第。敢玩游戏的，比如你内存不足了得会改中断和加扩展内存啊。</p>
<p>游戏往往跟别的娱乐简直不是一个级别的比较。比如当年比较简单的游戏形式为 Multi-User Dungeons (MUD) ，想起最近我在看互动教娃之类的感触，我了解到美国有一个做了十多年的  inquiry-based learning  叫 <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/company/about">AoPS</a> ，我被这种教学方式震撼了。因为我自己有娃才知道这样做有多难，这种方式是首先老师得在某个学科、领域有「完备」的知识储备，然后娃从一个 problem 开始提问，你跟他讲解需要理解的解决方法，需要储备的基础知识，解决这一个问题之后，需要把得到的经验总结然后形式化，然后提出更多的问题，进而学习到所有数学知识。要通过软件做到这一点，就需要对知识树进行建模然后做一个有向无环的遍历。然后找着找着发现一些写小说的工具就有这样的功能，你先整理一个时间观和人物关系大纲，然后每个章节就是这些联系的具体实现和阐述。突然我意识到，这 TM 不就是几十年前互动文本 RPG 游戏的核心原理么。你需要创建很多 NPC 对话的上下文并且穷举所有的选项组合，这不就等效于整理某个学科知识来做一个教学系统么。再比如，游戏里创建3D场景，如今被ILM从《The Mandalorian》开始引入好莱坞，无绿幕拍摄已经快称为行业基操。所以当时玩的不是游戏，而是玩的是计算机图形学和美学的最前沿成就。</p>
<p>记得我小时候，玩电子游戏还约等于玩小霸王。这玩意在当年被美名其曰「学习机」，但实际上买回来都被拿来玩FC红白机了。这事其实在国外也发生过，无数高手都是通过折腾 Commodore 64 无师自通了 6502 汇编。这又让我想起了文曲星，很多人走向码农就是因为初高中被一个能写 BASIC 代码的电子辞典给迷上了。能在这些设备玩上游戏，那只是无数对技术钻研的汗水、执着和努力的一项亮眼的成果而已。</p>
<p>而如今呢，天下游戏，不归吃鸡便归MOBA。纵然这两种类型也有其乐趣之处，但是其玩法为了迎合市场和几十亿人口，把门槛已经降到了最低并且能恰到好处的维持一定量的兴奋值，这一切都归功于数值策划的在反胃和上瘾之间作出的微妙平衡。</p>
<p>所以归根结底为啥电子阳痿呢，游戏已经被太多的人玩滥了。它没有与众不同的属性，它不 cool，它除了赢得一局带来的短暂成就感，并不能带来「与众不同」的持续归属感。商业的力量让电子游戏称为一个能挣钱的行业，但商业也让电子游戏从上古时期的 玩游戏-拆游戏-再发明游戏 的双向过程，变成了充值消费就能变强的单向过程，让人在赢得了对手或者 AI 之后变得无比的寂寞，这一种空虚的贤者时间让人觉得我 TM 为啥电子阳痿了；</p>
<p>以前玩游戏在没网的情况下，人会尽可能发挥主观能动性钻研出自己的绝招和攻略，形成一个硬核的玩家群体，现在的游戏则是尽可能的缩小可能性，让大多数玩家在有限的设定里去尽可能充值。玩家还会丧失主动感。</p>
<p>所以什么样的游戏才不会阳痿呢？我细数了一下我自己还经常玩的，类似 Civ，Rimworld，Mount n' Blade 这种，简单机制但是有无穷组合可能性的；GTA、少女卷轴这种开放世界的；Valheim，Minecraft 这种能造独一无二的东西装逼的。它们的共同特点就是缓解或者解决了我上面提到的种种问题。</p></p>

              <h2 class="card-title">开源 和 Meritocracy</h2>
            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>前几天跟人闲聊到国际纠纷和就业形势，聊到各行各业疲惫，然后转进到为啥互联网和软件行业比较和国际接轨。大家基本意见都是开源运动和 Open-source Software 在这里面功不可没。毕竟Linux没来之前 WPS 就被 MS Office 干了下去，民族软件面对几亿美刀研发费用的商业软件研发集团究竟是独木难支。</p>
<p>突然想到一个架空场景，如果某一天，老美突然发功，使得大陆大陆无法可靠获得某一版本号之后的所有开源软件，会发生什么？</p>
<p>当然，有人马上会说，国内大神会跟上进度的。比如国家可以安排一系列课题让一堆博士维护开源项目。的确，中国人和中国公司参与了很多<a href="/201906/stdout-003">open source project</a>，国内也有 <a href="https://blog.gitee.com/2020/08/17/gitee-gxb/">工信部支持</a>的gitee 和 <a href="https://gitlab.cn/">极狐Gitlab</a>，资金方面也有 <a href="http://license.coscl.org.cn/">木兰协议</a> 、<a href="https://www.openatom.org/">开放原子基金会</a>(民政部注册)，有人说如果都到了撕破脸禁用开源软件了，那么就真脱钩了，也不用管那么多直接拿来用就是了。</p>
<p>甚至有人说，其实开源都留了后手，比如Facebook 的 React，协议里也埋坑说，有权禁止竞争对手使用，最终解释权归他们。其实说起 Facebook(现称meta)，<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/65491011/answer/2700413148">最新的消息</a>是：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>他知道带有专利条款的许可迟早会在开源社区引爆负面讨论，他跟法务部门负责开源项目许可的律师沟通，但对方就是坚持为了保护公司利益必须要这样做。等到开源社区开始重视这件事情的时候，他找基础架构部门的副总裁也就是他顶上的大老板寻求帮助，结果副总裁跟双方开了个会之后选择站在律师那边，「你看人家律师的专业建议是这样子，你就照着做吧」。过了几个月，这个律师离职了，法务部门指派了另一个律师负责这件事情。前端平台部门的总监又跑去跟新的律师说要换 MIT 协议，结果新的律师完全没有尝试拒绝，「你们爱换就换吧，我觉得没问题」。然后就变成 MIT 协议了……</p>
</blockquote>
<p>回到开源本身这个话题，假设一个场景，如果在某个时刻，比如Chromium V20的时候，国内不能继续跟进最新版本，假设需要独立改进，需要花多少力气才能把H.264、CSS3、H5、WebRTC 等等一大堆新玩意补齐？如果你只能拿到 2.6 的 Kernel 代码，那么你如何才能魔改出来一个  5.10 的内核？</p>
<p>就算天降猛人，把这个事儿做到了，但是如果天降了3个猛人，小米搞了一套，华为搞了另一套，Oppo 搞了第三套，相互不兼容，又怎么办？比如苏联也有自己的一套完整的基于电子管的软硬件系统一样。</p>
<p>国内独立搞出来的项目，其实也有，比如 统一推送联盟</p>
<p><img alt="" src="/images/2022/stderr-09-01.webp" /></p>
<p>从 <a href="https://www.huxiu.com/article/640522.html">huxiu</a>、<a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/439729608">zhihu</a> 的键盘分析师的观点来看，凉凉。。。甚至<a href="https://36kr.com/p/1880989350055297">连官网都没了</a></p>
<p>再比如，腾讯自己搞一套小程序，阿里也搞一套，各个银行都有自己小程序，各个安卓ROM厂家也搞了个「快应用 quickapp.cn」，再比如广电花了<a href="https://www.birtv.com/aspcms/news/2015-8-3/2112.html">48+20亿</a>搞了地面波 DTMB+CMMB，其中就有一项对口 MPEG-4 的<a href="http://www.avs.org.cn/aboutus.asp">AVS1</a> 视频编码格式，如果每个手机厂家相机app拍摄出来的格式互不兼容，快手抖音的视频上传和CDN转码会不会搞得巨复杂？</p>
<p>其实开源项目世界里，各个 contributor 各怀鬼胎把项目往不同的方向上拉扯，国外的例子也很多，比如最近 CMGS 写的《<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/W_9XYkF5Y_-M-aLdB-b_Ng">How k8s Fucked</a>》</p>
<p>写到这里，我突然想明白，开源软件的利害之处，除了技术可以不断被人推动进步，还有一个重要的就是「社区」和「方向」</p>
<p>这个是个很主观的东西，Firefox 也开源，比 Google 更标准，但是就是玩不过 Chromium。Linux为啥就能比BSD更流行？pg各方面都更先进，但是MySQL占有率就是更高。这里面的确有各种机缘巧合，以及金钱的因素，但是社区氛围和恰当的目标才是最重要的。个人觉得，如果国内独立做开源，问题可能不在于技术，而是朝一个方向齐心协力推动的氛围。</p>
<p>这个推演结论，突然让我想起了之前看到 princeton.edu 的一篇雄文：<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/a-belief-in-meritocracy-is-not-only-false-its-bad-for-you">A belief in meritocracy is not only false: it’s bad for you</a></p>
<p>英语单词 meritocracy 字面上看它好像是「美德主义」，经常被翻译成「精英领导」，，其实这没把内涵翻译出来，这词的本意是「谁有本事谁厉害」</p>
<blockquote>
<p>government or the holding of power by people selected on the basis of their ability</p>
</blockquote>
<p>从直觉上来说，能者上有啥问题？在开源软件来说，很多都是项目发起人，或者技术最厉害的人主导一个项目。我觉得这就是很典型的 meritocracy。这篇文章其实点明了几个 meritocracy 的问题：</p>
<ol>
<li>一个人的成就或者成功，往往是运气。所谓风口来了，吹起来了一堆猪</li>
<li>天份，和努力程度，往往是运气选中了那颗喜欢努力的精子，所以由遗传和抚养环境决定。</li>
<li>meritocracy 最终会导致一个人自私，或者说自负。</li>
</ol>
<p>当然这文章也藏了私货。meritocracy不好？gratitude 才好。要感恩！嗯最后估计说人人都有 sin 了。。。2333。其实 meritocracy 这矛盾在中国哲学看来很容易破解，侠之大者，为国为民。最高的能力，就是帮助他人的能力。</p>
<p>开源运动也是这样，最高的能力，就是他利用欧美成熟而刚性的版权制度，传染性的去传播自由。这是他超越软件工程能力最伟大的地方。</p>
<p>（完）</p>

<p>后记：最近才了解的知识，GPL是<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.zh-cn.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic">允许</a>修改、使用源码并且不公开源码的。前提是你不公开。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GPL不要求你发布你的修改版或者任何一部分修改版。你有自由修改并自用，而不必发布。这个规则也适用于机构（包括公司）；机构可以做出修改版并在内部使用而不向其他外部组织发布。<br />
但是如果你以某种方式把修改版向公众发布，GPL就要求你向用户提供修改版的源代码。<br />
在公司内部使用只是公司为自己制作拷贝。因此，公司或组织可以开发自己的修改版并在内部部署，其员工也无权对外发布。<br />
然而，当公司把拷贝发送给其他组织或个人时，就是发布。具体来说，为合同商提供拷贝来离岸使用就是发布。</p>

              <h2 class="card-title">Corporate Memphis：大厂孟菲斯</h2>
            </a>
            <p class="card-text"><p>今天 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32823472">HN 上</a>有个讨论 tailwind /open-props<br />
的帖子，发现这个20后所谓「woke」 科技公司的美术风格有个名字</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Completely off topic, but what is the art style that all woke companies like Google/Facebook etc use called?<br />
Corporate Memphis</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Corporate_Memphis_%282019%29.jpg/580px-Corporate_Memphis_%282019%29.jpg" /></p>
<p>翻了下 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Memphis">wikipedia</a> 最早可以追溯到2017年 Facebook 找 Buck Studios 外包设计的一个风格套件 facebook-alegria。孟菲斯名字和风格来自于意大利设计师 Ettore Sottsass 在80年代的设计厂 Memphis Group 。</p>
<p>Corporate memphis 的别称：</p>
<ul>
<li>Alegria style 快乐风 （alegria是西、葡、意语里joy的意思）</li>
<li>Globohomo 全球搞基</li>
<li>Big Tech art style 大厂风范</li>
</ul>
<p>国内有对这种风格的报道比如 <a href="http://fashion.sina.com.cn/luxury/de/2018-09-09/0827/doc-ihiixyeu4453522.shtml">sina</a></p>
<p>个人感觉这是17年左右苹果搞拍扁风带来的风气？我对这种艺术风格比较无感。</p></p>
