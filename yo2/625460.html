  <p>有一篇很老的文章，讲：<a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">花10年的时间学会编程</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's my recipe for programming success:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get interested in programming, and do some because it is fun. Make sure<br>
that it keeps being enough fun so that you will be willing to put in ten<br>
years.</li>
<li>Talk to other programmers; read other programs. This is more important<br>
than any book or training course.</li>
<li>Program. The best kind of learning is<br>
<a href="http://www.engines4ed.org/hyperbook/nodes/NODE-120-pg.html"><br>
learning by doing</a>. To put it more technically, "the maximal level of<br>
performance for individuals in a given domain is not attained automatically<br>
as a function of extended experience, but the level of performance can be<br>
increased even by highly experienced individuals as a result of deliberate<br>
efforts to improve."<br>
<a href="http://www2.umassd.edu/swpi/DesignInCS/expertise.html">(p. 366)</a><br>
and "the most effective learning requires a well-defined task with an<br>
appropriate difficulty level for the particular individual, informative<br>
feedback, and opportunities for repetition and corrections of errors." (p.<br>
20-21) The book <i><br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521357349">Cognition in<br>
Practice: Mind, Mathematics, and Culture in Everyday Life</a></i> is an<br>
interesting reference for this viewpoint.</li>
<li>If you want, put in four years at a college (or more at a graduate<br>
school). This will give you access to some jobs that require credentials,<br>
and it will give you a deeper understanding of the field, but if you don't<br>
enjoy school, you can (with some dedication) get similar experience on the<br>
job. In any case, book learning alone won't be enough. "Computer science<br>
education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying<br>
brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter" says Eric Raymond,<br>
author of <i>The New Hacker's Dictionary</i>. One of the best programmers I<br>
ever hired had only a High School degree; he's produced a lot of<br>
<a href="http://www.xemacs.org">great</a> <a href="http://www.mozilla.org"><br>
software</a>, has his own<br>
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=alt.fan.jwz&amp;meta=site%3Dgroups"><br>
news group</a>, and made enough in stock options to buy his own<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_Lounge">nightclub</a>.</li>
<li>Work on projects with other programmers. Be the best programmer on some<br>
projects; be the worst on some others. When you're the best, you get to test<br>
your abilities to lead a project, and to inspire others with your vision.<br>
When you're the worst, you learn what the masters do, and you learn what<br>
they don't like to do (because they make you do it for them).</li>
<li>Work on projects <i>after</i> other programmers. Be involved in<br>
understanding a program written by someone else. See what it takes to<br>
understand and fix it when the original programmers are not around. Think<br>
about how to design your programs to make it easier for those who will<br>
maintain it after you.</li>
<li>Learn at least a half dozen programming languages. Include one language<br>
that supports class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that supports<br>
functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML), one that supports syntactic<br>
abstraction (like Lisp), one that supports declarative specifications (like<br>
Prolog or C++ templates), one that supports coroutines (like Icon or<br>
Scheme), and one that supports parallelism (like Sisal).</li>
<li>Remember that there is a "computer" in "computer science". Know how long<br>
it takes your computer to execute an instruction, fetch a word from memory<br>
(with and without a cache miss), read consecutive words from disk, and seek<br>
to a new location on disk. (<a href="#answers">Answers here.</a>)</li>
<li>Get involved in a language standardization effort. It could be the ANSI<br>
C++ committee, or it could be deciding if your local coding style will have<br>
2 or 4 space indentation levels. Either way, you learn about what other<br>
people like in a language, how deeply they feel so, and perhaps even a<br>
little about why they feel so.</li>
<li>Have the good sense to get off the language standardization effort as<br>
quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
